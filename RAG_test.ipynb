       " Document(page_content=\"&gt;DOTA already addressed - computers were beating the world's best chess grandmasters in the 1980s, and was beating non-professional but highly experienced chess players in the *1960s*. A computer being better at being a computer than a human is nothing new or impressive.This is NOTHING like the chess example.  You should consider doing some research or reading an article before making such claims.  F  Chess is an extremely simple game to program a solution.  It's a 2v2 board with a finite amount of squares and there's always a clear optimal solution.  OpenAI picked Dota2 because they, and many gamers alike, consider it to be the #1 most complicated competitive game that is currently popular.   This is **nothing** like programming an aim bot in a shooter that simply is faster and more accurate at shooting.  They specifically added a delay to its actions and decision making to prevent it from having an intrinsic mechanical advantage to players.  Dota already comes with bot programming developed by Valve, and it's extremely bad.  Any player above the 20th percentile of players can handily beat them.Let me also educate you on how machine learning works, as I have some limited experience developing models and doing math behind the equations in college.  The fundamental requirement for training AI is data collection and interpretation.  Consider the example of chess.  There are 64 squares and 32 total pieces.  You collect the data from all the different possible positions such that your program is able to learn an equation with 64 + 32 variables.  You know how in algebra you learn to simplify equations like y = mx+b?  Now imagine if you created a program that could always find the answer to a = b+c+d+e+f+g+h+i+j+k+.......  And this is a huge simplification for the chess example.  In Dota, the map is gigantic.  11,000 x 11,000 places you can stand.  Describing the mechanics of the game would be really time consuming, but there is a LOT to know.  Just getting to the very lowest rung of the matchmaking pool usually requires someone to sink 500 hours into the game.  There are 100+ heroes with 4 different abilities.  They limited their own hero selection pool to 17, but the amount of matchups it has to account for is staggering.  There are also 100+ items you can buy during the game, and there is the issue of teamwork.  What is the most efficient way to utilize 5 different players to win the game?   To create an optimal decision making algorithm for dota, the number of variables and things to consider is so large, I cannot fathom it.And they didn't just beat the #1 best pro team in the world. They have permanently changed how Dota is played by its player base. The deep blue program just played freakishly good chess.  It didn't invent new methods of playing that no one ever heard of.   OpenAI's Dota project revealed efficiencies in playing the game that no human beings were able to discover on their own, and have been emulating ever since.To say that this is not an impressive feat is honestly just ignorant.   If you can train a bot to play the #1 most complicated combat/strategy game that exists, beating teams that have spent their lives glued to their computer doing this, who's to say you cannot program a bot to do the work of a financial analyst at a bank?  Forget the self driving trucks, the call center discussions.  White collar jobs are no longer safe.  We will soon be competing against an entity that is smarter and superior to us.  And this is all done with OpenAI's current technology including LLM's and neural network.  Read up on the reason Sam Altman was fired, project Q*\"),\n",

If we reduced Earth's energy imbalance and its temperature at current CO2 level back to 1980 situation so that things would be the same except we continue emitting CO2 as before, you are asking whether 44 years later, in 2068, there is more or less warming, assuming we keep emitting as before.As we know, we approximately doubled fossil fuel use and thus our CO2 emissions from 1980 level to reach 2024 level. Assuming we can't continue increasing fossil fuel use due to depletion, and we in fact might be seeing the reverse side of our fossil fuel peak, we might increase CO2 level by about the same amount in the coming 44 years as we did in the past 44 years.I think temperature would be less because CO2 has a logarithmic effect. Fixed increases early, at low concentration, are more significant than fixed increases later. This is probably why Earth system sensitivity is approximated as the temperature increase caused to planet by doubling of CO2, because the physics of the gas works like this.This analysis, however, neglects a whole lot of other processes that are important and could even dominate over CO2, like permafrost melting, albedo changes due to progressive loss of ice cover in the planet, the likely collapse of the entire food web of the oceans due to acidification, and so forth. It merely highlights that purely CO2-driven warming should slow down, as each increase in the gas concentration has less of an effect. It should take an exponential increase in CO2 to produce steady rate of warming.\"),\n",

Allow me to react and clarify certain points.\"if you have gone so far as believing that mass human suffering is worth the world being more fun for a select very few\"I consider myself a utilitarian, and I\\'m interested in the outcome only. From that perspective, I prefer minimized human suffering. For that, I struggle to see how kicking the can down the road helps in any way; it just temporarily moves the problem out of sight while actually inflating it.I acknowledge that many people are beyond hope, and no therapy or support will ever change this. They do suffer. Continuing to feed them (or adjusting to their needs) extends suffering for them and for anyone else who has to deal with the fact that resources and time are wasted on a lost cause. I look at the long-term impact, not short-term selection processes.\"or you don\\'t really grasp the implication of what \\'left behind\\' means\"I think I do. If someone has incurable cancer and no quality of life leftjust allow them to die instead of extending the suffering for a hypothetical cure that might be developed next year. Just allow them to die instead of interfering because people can\\'t stomach seeing other people die.\"You should know, though, that this is straight up Nazi shit. Full stop.\"I think the Nazi solution would be to actively kill them. My suggestion is to not prevent them from dying anymore because it\\'s unethical interference.\"The moment you set some parameter on what someone not contributing looks like and eliminate them, you\\'re missing out on anything they might have ever contributed, or their kids might have.\"I firmly believe that quality is not a myth. People vary greatly in their contribution to society. This can happen in many ways: social, technological, artistic, any way. People can be divided into net assets and net liabilities. The worth of people varies greatly. It is roughly reflected by how many people show up at someone\\'s funeral. Nobody? The person was a liability. Hundreds of people? The person was loved and is missed by the community. It reflects the value the human provided to others. Many people provide no value whatsoever. I\\'m confident that I\\'m stating facts here.\"Innovation isn\\'t about single great super-smart people inventing something and winning.\"I agree. I also acknowledge that creation consists of creation itself, preservation of the existing, and destroying the obsolete. I feel we\\'re very preservation-heavy currently. I don\\'t talk about individual winning. I mean it like, since we have the wheel and fire alreadygive it to ALL the people now! Allow them to create with it or to get hurt by it (and learn while doing so). Just don\\'t protect an old status quo. Let\\'s use the new wheel!\"Helping people who need it is an investment. We are constantly getting benefit from doing that. People contribute constantly in ways you cannot understand or predict. There is no leaving people behind and shedding the weight. Trying to leave people behind fucks us all over.\"This strikes me as wrong and full of naive illusion and hope. Admittedly, it sounds nice, but it doesn\\'t reflect my life experience. The weight needs to be shed before it\\'s so heavy that it becomes unbearable for those actively contributing (paying taxes, innovating, creating). I was part of so many projects that blossomed so much after we shed the weight and continued only with those who were hungry, driven, and motivated. Those who prefer to chill can do this somewhere else, just don\\'t be in the way of the actual creators!\"If you want faster progress, you want more people to have the ability to contribute, and you have no idea who that has the potential to be.\"I mainly want no lazy and unmotivated people around who are fed the illusion that there is enough for a good life for all of us. This is not the case.

There are a lot of incredibly brilliant climate scientists and scicomm professionals out there, and the likelihood that this concept has been overlooked is slim.

Nothing about the value of cultural burning by Indigenous tribes, or the dangers of continued home building in flammable areas in and around forests.  &gt;  &gt;Maybe thats a lot to ask of a parade.  &gt;  &gt;But with the fate of life as we know it hanging in the balance, how can we not ask?Would it be that hard for NBC and the federal officials behind Smokey Bear to include just a little information about what we can do to stave off total climate catastrophe, in a parade broadcast watched by tens of millions of people?If you want to get my column in your inbox twice a week, you can sign up for our Boiling Point newsletter here: [latimes.com/boilingpoint]( Thank you!\"),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Ok you have now exposed yourself as a climate denier. You try to cover that by lying about being open minded. It\\'s pretty obvious when like all climate deniers you refuse to answer questions about what you actually accept. You can say believe or any other word you want to use but it\\'s still refusing to answer because if you are really a denier you can get backed into a corner real quick with your answers. So I will now treat you as a denier. I will continue to respond to your lies about climate science but only to alert someone new that your responses are not science.Climate scientists have models that correctly project the temperatures and correctly predict several things that are happening. Since the models are based on the physics of greenhouse gases it shows the theory is correct. When deniers come up with another legitimate cause for the warming and are able to produce models that correct project that warming then they will have a case. Until then they understand that their only option is to try to discredit some minor detail if they can. And that is exactly what you are doing by posting debunked denier talking points but doing a poor job.&gt;As always, climate scientists often make significant claims which get amplified in the media. But when future data proves wrong, nobody points that out (\"the rest of the story\"). Scientist have no control over what the media says or if anything amplified is pointed out.&gt;They just roll into another angle, whatever brings in funding dollars. Engineering and Physics research is no different, it is all about the dollars. The funding is on the denier side with millions of dollars from oil companies every year that have that kind of money. Research in any country or any field of science does require money regardless of the results. But you don\\'t see scientist becoming millionaires. Most scientists are just making average salaries for their education level that have dedicated their lives to understanding some field of science so humans can have a better life. If a climate scientist is interested in money, they would go to work for an oil company where they could make big bucks and a few have.&gt;Yes, I am skeptical of all academic research and Physics, Inc.But I\\'d bet you have no problem using all the advances that have been brought about by Physics and academic research over the past 200 years.'),\n",

If anything, this is just good evidence that solar is being deployed well and at scale.

It has always been defined as 20 or 30-year average for a year being above that. 20- or 30- year average was chosen because longer period over which the average is measured provides more accurate estimates. It paints the most realistic picture of actual warming, that\\'s why it was chosen it the first place. 5 or 10-year average would be more sensitive to multi-year fluctuations and therefore less accurate.Most climate models dont expect actual warming to pass 1.5C until the early-to-mid 2030s. The 1.5C and 2C warming thresholds have been defined in terms of the trend line. Not individual years.Proposed method for determining long-term average for a given year is taking an average of previous 10/15 years and the following 10/15 years. We know that the average for current year is 1.2-1.3c from data from previous 10 years and projections for the next 10 years.\"The widely available global average temperature for a specific year isn\\'t a suitable indicator for determining if the \"Paris 1.5\" threshold has been surpassed. The Paris Agreement focuses on long-term warming trends rather than yearly fluctuations. However, there has not been a formally agreed-upon alternative approach established yet.\"Clarity on breaching the Paris Agreement guard rails will be crucial. Without an agreement on what actually will count as exceeding 1.5 C, we risk distraction and confusion at precisely the time when action to avoid the worst effects of climate change becomes even more urgent.\"-Richard A. Betts MBE, Study Lead Author and Head, Climate Impacts Research, Met Office Hadley Center\"Betts says, Using the average global temperature over the last 20 years would mean we would have to wait ten years to confirm whether the 1.5 C ceiling has been reached: creating a decade of otherwise preventable delay. Today we are recommending an indicator combining the last ten years of global temperature observations with an estimate of the projection or forecast for the next ten years. If adopted, this could mean a universally agreed measure of global warming that could trigger immediate action to avoid further rises.The scientists found that the figure for the current global warming level is around 1.26 C using this recommended approach, with an uncertainty range of 1.13 C to 1.43 C.\" methods with all datasets put current warming around 1.2C to 1.3C\"nitter.perennialte.ch/richardabetts/status/1732849860582187039#m\"A single year above 1.5C (or 2C for that matter) would not mean that the world has passed that temperature target. Given the warming rate of 0.2C per decade since 1970, and the fact that a super El Nino event can add up to 0.2C to a specific years global temperatures through natural variability, it is possible for us to see a single year exceeding 1.5C a full decade before the long-term average warming driven by human emissions of greenhouse gases does.Because of this, we should be a bit cautious about how we interpret the first year passing 1.5C (whether it happens in 2023, 2024, or later)! Most models dont expect the longer term average to pass 1.5C until the early-to-mid 2030s, but we do expect many individual years to pass 1.5C before then.\" 1.5C and 2C warming thresholds have been defined in terms of the trend line. Not individual years, let alone months, weeks, or days (the shorter the time period, the larger the random fluctuations). Those who imply otherwise are misleading you. We are talking about the average state of the system. ...That is how the impacts have been defined, so that is implicit in the definition of 1.5C (or 2C) as danger thresholds--those thresholds are tied to specific impacts that happen at those levels of average warming\"nitter.perennialte.ch/MichaelEMann/status/1726627380968686017'),\n",
