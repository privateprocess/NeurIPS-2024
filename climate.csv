Here's what actual definition of passing 1.5c is-

""A single year above 1.5C (or 2C for that matter) would not mean that the world has passed that temperature target. Given the warming rate of 0.2C per decade since 1970, and the fact that a super El Nino event can add up to 0.2C to a specific year’s global temperatures through natural variability, it is possible for us to see a single year exceeding 1.5C a full decade before the long-term average warming driven by human emissions of greenhouse gases does. Because of this, we should be a bit cautious about how we interpret the first year passing 1.5C (whether it happens in 2023, 2024, or later)! Most models don’t expect the longer term average to pass 1.5C until the early-to-mid 2030""

These morons also claim that IPCC models don't include aerosols, methane from permafrost and emissions from wildfires, which is demonstrably false-

\&gt; IPCC processes did not find an adequate way to address issues of extreme risk where data was deemed insufficient or where there was higher uncertainty \*, such as aerosols, methane release from permafrost, and feedbacks from wildfires or droughts rendering sinks incapable of sustaining their role in the system.

If what they claim is true, then why are climate models used in previous IPCC reports so accurate and have predicted the pace of warming and most climate extremes so well, including exceptionally warm years like 2023? Observed warming tends to track middle-of-the-range estimates from previous IPCC reports.

Lower the temperature of water from 0.000001 C to 0.0000001 C and it is still liquid water. Then lower the temperature again the same fraction of a degree and it has a profound change of state from a liquid to a solid. Not only that, but the density of the solid is less(!!!!!) than the density of the liquid, allowing life to survive on our planet.

Another really fascinating phase transition is from a normal metal to a superconductor. Lowering the temperature of certain metals, which have resistance (albeit small) to the flow of electrons (electrical current) can result in a phase transition to a zero resistance superconductor state. Not close to zero resistance, but actually exactly zero resistance. 

When physicists do their physicist things, they can treat our transition from the Holocene Era to the Anthropocene Era as a phase transition.

As a result, they build theoretical models to study this transition, and these models build on superconductor models using Logistic Maps, lots of impressive equations, and something called Ginsburg-Landau theory.

What they find is that it is theoretically possible for the climate state of the Earth to transition from our present state to a state of utter chaotic behaviour; literally a state of chaos.

We probably don’t want this to happen, but that seems to be where we are headed.

381402,kd1lcu8,2,"DUBAI — Mona Ainuu wiped away tears as she reacted to a draft agreement at the U.N. Climate Change Conference here, her voice shaking as she contemplated her small island nation of Niue sinking into the sea.

“We’re drowning with sea level rise,” Ainuu, the Niuean minister of natural resources, told reporters. “We’re losing our land. We’re losing people. … My 12-year old, what am I going to say to her when I come back?”

Like Ainuu, many delegates from vulnerable nations voiced frustration and anger at the draft deal unveiled Monday night at the climate summit, known as COP28. Unlike previous versions, the document did not [call for phasing out fossil fuels](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/12/10/un-climate-conference-fossil-fuels-dubai/?itid=lk_inline_manual_5), the root cause of rising global temperatures that have wrought devastation across the globe in the past year.

Instead, the deal suggests “reducing both consumption and production of fossil fuels, in a just, orderly and equitable manner"" so that the world reaches net-zero emissions by mid-century. The language reflects a compromise among negotiators from nearly 200 nations, including fossil-fuel-dependent countries such as the United Arab Emirates — the host of this year’s talks and the world’s seventh-largest oil producer.

The draft agreement is nearly the last step before the conclusion of COP28, at which, under the 2015 Paris agreement, countries are supposed to address how [to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/12/08/climate-change-threshold-cop28-dubai/?itid=lk_inline_manual_9&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_9) (2.7 Fahrenheit). Poor and vulnerable countries have pushed for the agreement to include a phaseout of fossil fuels as the best chance of hitting the 1.5C target, a threshold beyond which scientists have warned of catastrophic effects, including flooded coastal cities and mass die-offs of coral reefs.

Climate groups widely critiqued the text as being watered down, and they said it reflected the world’s reluctance to emphatically close out the era of coal, oil and gas. But the text, in even mentioning the desired reduction of fossil fuel consumption and production, would break new territory — if agreed to. No prior agreement from international climate talks, including the 2015 Paris accord, has directly taken on the topic of fossil fuels, instead focusing on the need to reduce emissions.

Metal mining is already on the scale of 5 GT ore per year. This is expected to rise, amongst other in light of historically falling commercially viable grades (you first mine the ""good"" stuff).

Furthermore, the bot blindly links a discredited article to back up its dubious claim that ""Stabilizing the climate means getting human greenhouse gas emissions to approximately zero."" - Read the comments on that piece for clarification.

The bot - being a bot - is incapable of nuanced discussion.  Incapable of proper debate, or understanding criticism of its arguments.  It just targets key words and replies with template answers.  It's spam and has no place in what should be a forum for discussion between actual people.  It should be deleted and banned.",climate,2024-05-14 06:32:20,1cqz0th,slowlyun,0,2,0,True,2021-09-17 15:03:25,27.0,0.0,1234.0,10279.0,11540.0,422,"So that’s most of what I want to ask right there in the title, but to expand slightly…
I feel like this must be a fairly common encounter these days, but for any who haven’t seen - there’s a type of online personality who dedicate their presence to stating that human induced climate change is now beyond our control. I’ve seen many on twitter, they will often go as far as to say that any effort to mitigate global warming is (at this stage) pointless. 
This is usually hinged on ideas/statements such as ‘it’s physically impossible to remove enough CO² on a short enough timescale to save humankind’, or (one I read today) “There is no scenario that results in lower CO² levels in the atmosphere. Not one. This is a certainty of physics.”. The other most common one is about the cooling effect of particulate pollutants currently mitigating some of the warming, arguing that reducing emissions now would actually cause MORE warming! 
I know it comes off as fairly hyperbolic, but I’m trying to be sceptical in all directions! I see the work of James Hansen held up as evidence quite often and I’ve read about some of the problems with some of his claims, but don’t think I’ve read comprehensive rebuttals of all his main points. 
Im hoping someone can talk broadly to the legitimacy of these kind of claims, particularly from a physics point of view. I’d also love to be directed to trusted research that proposes mitigation methods.

Thanks in advance.

edit: 

&gt; How Do Banks Create Loans?

&gt; Banks do not create loans from bank reserves or bank deposits. Banks create a loan asset and a deposit liability on their balance sheets. This is how they create credit. The loan creates the deposit, of which reserves need to be held against, provided by the central bank.

&gt; Do Banks Create New Money When They Loan?

&gt; Yes, banks create new money when they make loans. This is done through accounting entries when a bank makes a loan and creates a deposit account.

Banks create new money when they give out a loan. They are not lending the money you have deposited in your account. If you want to criticize banks for lending money to fossil fuel projects: fair enough, but at least understand how the system works in the first place.

Your right ocean temperatures are not isothermal, meaning that the bottom of the ocean is still much colder than surface temperatures.

Heat or specific heat, is the measure of how much energy a unit of fluid must gain to have it's temperature raised by a certain unit of in °'s; I.E. the sum of a volume of fluids kenetic energy.

Temperature is the average kenetic energy an arbitrary volume of fluid per unit of volume.


If I have a pot of water boiling on the stove, it's temperature is much greater @ ~ 100°C  than a lake thats nearly frozen over and near 0°C.

But the pot on the stove only has a few liters of water, vs the lake which has thousands of gallons.

This the lake even at much colder temperatures, has much more stored kenetic energy overall all, even though it's near freezing.

Because oceans have circulating convection currents, the the temperature ris that we discuss represents an increase in the total averaged temperature of the total volume in the oceans.

These climate action plans also identify new economic opportunities to support clean and green industries, ensure low-income and minorities communities are included in the planning, and support public health benefits gained by reducing various types of environmental pollution.

It’s passed peer review.

SS: From the tell no bullshit James Hansen...

Global warming in the pipeline is greater than prior estimates. Eventual global warming due to today's GHG forcing alone -- after slow feedbacks operate -- is about 10°C.

I am not sure what I can add, if there is a lack of understanding on how the CURRENT EMITTED GHGs will lead to an inevitable 10C temp rise, there not much I can add.  Several climate scientists insist 2C mean the collapse of civilisation as it will cascade to at least 4C, this posits we're already past the point of no return ad we WILL get to 10C, that's a human extinction level event, far beyond the purview of collapse I guess.

If you do a critical analysis of all farming, plant based farming is just as devastating as animal farming, and its outdated techniques used by both are the problem. Grain farming is especially devastating.

You're not going to strategically weaken us. We're already sick and tired of your government mandated metabolic disorder.

If you want to control cow methane, stop feeding them grain; especially not processed grain. It makes them just as unhealthy as it does to us.

We know the strategic removal of the germ layer of seeds grains and nuts is a major causal factor in metabolic disorder and poor metabolism in animals and humans.

I feel like this must be a fairly common encounter these days, but for any who haven’t seen - there’s a type of online personality who dedicate their presence to stating that human induced climate change is now beyond our control. I’ve seen many on twitter, they will often go as far as to say that any effort to mitigate global warming is (at this stage) pointless. 
This is usually hinged on ideas/statements such as ‘it’s physically impossible to remove enough CO² on a short enough timescale to save humankind’, or (one I read today) “There is no scenario that results in lower CO² levels in the atmosphere. Not one. This is a certainty of physics.”. The other most common one is about the cooling effect of particulate pollutants currently mitigating some of the warming, arguing that reducing emissions now would actually cause MORE warming! 
I know it comes off as fairly hyperbolic, but I’m trying to be sceptical in all directions! I see the work of James Hansen held up as evidence quite often and I’ve read about some of the problems with some of his claims, but don’t think I’ve read comprehensive rebuttals of all his main points. 
Im hoping someone can talk broadly to the legitimacy of these kind of claims, particularly from a physics point of view. I’d also love to be directed to trusted research that proposes mitigation methods.

Thanks in advance.

250969,kq11avm,6,"WELLESLEY, Mass.—The Wellesley Rotary Club was having a perfectly ordinary country club dinner on Thursday, Jan. 25, until about 18 climate activists hopped on stage and started talking about fossil fuels.

“Brian Moynihan is one of the top five funders of fossil fuels causing the climate crisis,” Izzi Graj said to the crowd, before turning to event speaker and Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan. Other demonstrators crowded around the stage silently unfurled one banner reading “Bank of Atrocities,” with the Bank of America logo and another reading “Business as Usual is a Climate Disaster.”

“Brian, you’re killing us, and turning a blind eye to devastating suffering,” Graj said to Moynihan, voice raised to combat groans from the crowd that had paid $100 a head to attend the event, and wasn’t interested in hearing how Bank of America was ranked one of the top five global financiers of fossil fuels in Banking on Climate Chaos’ latest report. Since the Wellesley action, Bank of America has also backtracked on prior commitments to stop financing coal.

L
But Climate Defiance, whose members in attendance had also purchased tickets for the event, was determined to make sure the audience couldn’t ignore that reality. The youth-led direct action organization born last March has a laser-focused mission: to use disruptive, strictly non-violent direct actions to speed the end of U.S. reliance on fossil fuels. It’s part of a growing ecosystem of climate organizations that are using direct action to try to increase the political urgency to act on climate change, and get power players and the American public to respond to the science that shows meeting global climate goals requires a phase-out of fossil fuel use. It enters the scene following groups like Extinction Rebellion, Fridays for the Future and the Sunrise Movement—climate action-oriented organizations that have made waves nationally and globally. 

But even among peer organizations, Climate Defiance stands out for its tactic of birddogging the prominent people it targets and its rapid rise to notoriety. Since its inception last spring, the group has made frequent headlines and racked up millions of social media views, pursuing heavy hitters like Vice President Kamala Harris, White House national climate advisor Ali Zaidi, Senator Joe Manchin, Federal Reserve Bank Chair Jerome Powell, ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods and President Joe Biden.

Most recently, the group—alongside partner organization Planet Over Profit—confronted former CIA director David Petraeus at a book talk in New York City on Friday, criticizing his firm’s involvement with the controversial Coastal GasLink pipeline in Canada and the excessive force and surveillance tactics used against pipeline opponents by Canadian police. Petraeus is chairman of the Global Institute at private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co, which is a majority stakeholder in the project.

The group is unusually well-funded for a scrappy activist organization, and has a penchant for attracting influential friends, from members of Congress to Hollywood stars.

Most of Climate Defiance’s actions follow the same simple formula executed in Wellesley: go to a fancy event with powerful, important people, loudly and visibly call them out for their fossil fuel ties and then post a video of the action on the internet. Respectability is not on the group’s list of priorities. 

“We’re a radical collective of young people,” the group posted on X in January. “We are un-professionalized and high-key unhinged.” 

At the Jan. 25 action in Wellesley, Moynihan did not respond to the group’s questions, and within minutes, he quietly exited the room as they followed him chanting, “off fossil fuels Brian, off fossil fuels.”

Many startling facts are revealed in this report: essentially the super rich 1% are responsible for 16% of global emissions, equivalent to the emissions of the poorest 66% of people (5 billion people) on the planet. How does this sound for inequality? 

It’s mind-boggling.

[Carbon capture systems would require 2,000 kWh per tonne of CO2 captured.](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fclim.2019.00010/full)

Now, remember that this is just what it takes to turn CO2 into a chemically stable substance. And being that it is the chemical process itself that requires this much, we will not be able to reduce it by much more. ***This is a hard fact about the energy needed for the chemical reaction to take place that traps the CO2.***

Also, this 2000 kWh/tonne estimate does not include the amount of power that would be required to run the fans that suck in the atmosphere. Nor does it include the energy required to contain, transfer, and dispose of the CO2 after it has been captured.

It should also be noted that this is based on our current most cutting-edge atmospheric carbon capture systems. A single plant can capture roughly 900 tonnes of CO2 each year.

Now that you have an idea of what it takes to capture carbon. We can now explore what it would take to bring us down to carbon neutral. That is capturing 1 tonne of CO2 for every tonne of CO2 we emit globally. Something that would only keep us stable at current levels. Not what it would take for us to begin reducing the amount.

First off, let's calculate how much energy would be required for a single plant to capture its yearly capacity of 900 tonnes.

900 tonnes * 2000 kWh/tCO2 = 1,800,000 kWh

So, for a single plant to capture 900 tonnes of CO2, ***not including*** power requirements for the fans, transportation, or disposal, it would require 1.8 million kWh of electricity.

Now, let's figure out how much CO2 we would need to produce to power a single carbon capture plant. [In 2019, the International Energy Association estimated that the global average of CO2 emitted per kWh was 475 grams of CO2 per 1 kWh.](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-energy-co2-status-report-2019/emissions)

475 gCO2/kWh * 1,800,000 kWh = 855,000,000 gCO2

1 gram = 0.000001 tonne

855,000,000 gCO2 = 855 tonnes

So, in order for us to lock 900 tonnes of CO2 into a stable chemical substance. We would need to produce 855 tones of CO2 just to meet the energy requirements of the chemical reaction. Add in the amount of energy required to run the fans to suck in the atmosphere, operate containment systems, and then transport and dispose of the carbon. You're now producing far more CO2 than you are actively capturing and removing from the system. In other words, carbon capture, with current technology, would produce more CO2 than could be captured. Thus solving nothing and actually make the problem worse.

Now, if this wasn't enough, there is the sheer scale of the problem. Assuming we could magically get these carbon capture systems to remove more CO2 than they produce. Let's calculate how many of them we would need just to reach carbon neutral. [Currently, humans collectively produce 37,120,000,000 tonnes of CO2 each year.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/276629/global-co2-emissions/)

37,120,000,000 tCO2 ÷ 900 tCO2/plant = 41,244,444 plants

This means that each plant can capture 900 tonnes of CO2 each year. We would need 41.2 million of these carbon capture plants running 24/7. So, how much energy would it then require us to remain carbon neutral?

41,244,444 plants * 1,800,000 kWh/year = 74,239,999,200,000 kWh

1 kWh = 0.000000001 tWh

74,239,999,200,000 kWh = 74,239.999 tWh

74,239.999 tWh, wow, that's a lot of electricity, right? But how much exactly is that? For comparison, [in a 2019 study by the International Energy Association, it was determined that the world uses 22,848 tWh of electricity each year.](https://www.iea.org/reports/electricity-information-overview/electricity-consumption)

74,239.999 tWh ÷ 22,848 tWh = 3.249

I feel like this must be a fairly common encounter these days, but for any who haven’t seen - there’s a type of online personality who dedicate their presence to stating that human induced climate change is now beyond our control. I’ve seen many on twitter, they will often go as far as to say that any effort to mitigate global warming is (at this stage) pointless. 
This is usually hinged on ideas/statements such as ‘it’s physically impossible to remove enough CO² on a short enough timescale to save humankind’, or (one I read today) “There is no scenario that results in lower CO² levels in the atmosphere. Not one. This is a certainty of physics.”. The other most common one is about the cooling effect of particulate pollutants currently mitigating some of the warming, arguing that reducing emissions now would actually cause MORE warming! 
I know it comes off as fairly hyperbolic, but I’m trying to be sceptical in all directions! I see the work of James Hansen held up as evidence quite often and I’ve read about some of the problems with some of his claims, but don’t think I’ve read comprehensive rebuttals of all his main points. 
Im hoping someone can talk broadly to the legitimacy of these kind of claims, particularly from a physics point of view. I’d also love to be directed to trusted research that proposes mitigation methods.

How Compatible Are Western European Dietary Patterns to Climate Targets? Accounting for Uncertainty of Life Cycle Assessments by Applying a Probabilistic Approach

There exist no inherently good reason to tax fuel. Fuel is good. Fuel literally power the human lifestyle. The use of fuel is inherently good.

Taxes are not inherently good or bad. They are powerful economic tools. 

What ever good or service you tax, you add a friction to the growth of a certain section of the economy. This can help or hurt the economy and the economy is very complicated.

Fuel literally fueled human economic growth for millennia.  Taxing fuel is taxing one of the fundamental pillars of the economy. Sadly using fossil fuels have a terrible waste product. CO2.

It is this waste product, CO2 that must be targeted with the highest precision.  Excess GHG production is a red limit for our current civilization. And we hit it a while a go. Right now the planetary climatic engines have been running above  temperature, and lately blowing seals everywhere.


This is not optional, we need fuels to eat. The waste fuel fossil fuels produces will destroy our world (not the world, just humanity).

1. The albedo feedback: as ice melts and the Earth grows darker, it absorbs more solar heat.
2. The decline in sulfate aerosols from ships, due to regulations requiring low-sulfur fuel oil. This has dramatically accelerated warming across the North Atlantic and North Pacific.

I think it used to be a really important component of conservative politics to think about the true sustainability and the long-term cost and benefit associated with sustainable living. But it’s really flown out the window since the bush days of investing in military complex in the Middle East to buy cheap oil. 

I also think that educating more people on climate change, the scientific and humanistic causes and the skills needed for solutions, including women, is necessary for changing the pulse of a culture. Therefore, I think it is important if you care about climate change to supporting strong education, and supporting women. An educated woman will have fewer children and will be able to spend more resources per child on care and education.

Lower the temperature of water from 0.000001 C to 0.0000001 C and it is still liquid water. Then lower the temperature again the same fraction of a degree and it has a profound change of state from a liquid to a solid. Not only that, but the density of the solid is less(!!!!!) than the density of the liquid, allowing life to survive on our planet.

Another really fascinating phase transition is from a normal metal to a superconductor. Lowering the temperature of certain metals, which have resistance (albeit small) to the flow of electrons (electrical current) can result in a phase transition to a zero resistance superconductor state. Not close to zero resistance, but actually exactly zero resistance. 

When physicists do their physicist things, they can treat our transition from the Holocene Era to the Anthropocene Era as a phase transition.

As a result, they build theoretical models to study this transition, and these models build on superconductor models using Logistic Maps, lots of impressive equations, and something called Ginsburg-Landau theory.

What they find is that it is theoretically possible for the climate state of the Earth to transition from our present state to a state of utter chaotic behaviour; literally a state of chaos.

We probably don’t want this to happen, but that seems to be where we are headed.

I feel like this must be a fairly common encounter these days, but for any who haven’t seen - there’s a type of online personality who dedicate their presence to stating that human induced climate change is now beyond our control. I’ve seen many on twitter, they will often go as far as to say that any effort to mitigate global warming is (at this stage) pointless. 
This is usually hinged on ideas/statements such as ‘it’s physically impossible to remove enough CO² on a short enough timescale to save humankind’, or (one I read today) “There is no scenario that results in lower CO² levels in the atmosphere. Not one. This is a certainty of physics.”. The other most common one is about the cooling effect of particulate pollutants currently mitigating some of the warming, arguing that reducing emissions now would actually cause MORE warming! 
I know it comes off as fairly hyperbolic, but I’m trying to be sceptical in all directions! I see the work of James Hansen held up as evidence quite often and I’ve read about some of the problems with some of his claims, but don’t think I’ve read comprehensive rebuttals of all his main points. 
Im hoping someone can talk broadly to the legitimacy of these kind of claims, particularly from a physics point of view. I’d also love to be directed to trusted research that proposes mitigation methods.

It is possible that we have reached that point with methane.

A few days ago I attended a webinar called “Methane Possible Tipping Points or Surprises”. 

Link: https://methane-possible-tipping-points-or-surprises.confetti.events/

Definitely, this webinar event is well worth watching (1.5 hour video presentation on link), but ONLY after watching this video first, of course:)

Basically, the sharp rise in global atmospheric methane concentrations since about 2007, coinciding with a continuing downward trend in the isotopic C-13 levels appear to be mostly do to enormous rises in methane emissions from tropical wetlands around the planet, with the lions share of the wetland methane originating from the African wetlands that are getting hotter, larger, and wetter as climate warming accelerates.

As I covered in a recent video, James Hansen’s landmark paper “Global Warming in the Pipeline” attributes most of this warming acceleration to a reduction of aerosols due to sulphur reductions by China and the Maritime Shipping Industry. 

I guess that is largely true, but I think that some of the strong warming increase can be attributed to the accelerating rise of methane, especially if we are really in a “Termination Zero Methane Event” as appears from data thus far, but this is by no means certain yet. If we are in Termination-0 then we can expect very strong and rapid methane increases over the next several decades, and these are feedbacks from the Earth wetland systems around the planet.

It is amazing to me that isotopic C-13 has declined so much recently, because fossil fuel emissions are rising at ever faster rates which should increase the isotopic C-13. What this can only mean is that methane emissions from the planetary systems is increasing that much faster than from fossil fuels that it is driving down the isotopic C-13 amounts. Very bad.

298614,kil39ac,4,"That’s addressed in this article as well. Some were existing leases and others were part of a compromise to get the Inflation Reduction Act passed to boost the transition to renewables. 

“According to many industry officials, policies regarding oil and gas seemed to change relatively little from the George W. Bush administration through the Obama administration and the Trump administration.

But that changed once Biden took office, said Lipow.

The same month he was sworn into office, Biden issued an executive order pausing permits for new oil and gas drilling and mandating more rigorous environmental reviews. In April of 2021, the administration set a target for a 50 to 52 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from 2005 levels.

That summer, the administration canceled a key permit for the Keystone XL pipeline and blocked permits to drill in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

Despite the initial pause in issuing permits for production on federal lands, permits to drill increased, outpacing the Trump administration.

Lipow said part of the reason for that is compromises the Biden administration had to make to pass the Inflation Reduction Act.

It forced the administration “to do a number of things,” Lipow said.

Among them was holding lease sales for millions of acres, including a sale for parcels of 958,000 acres in Alaska and one for 73.4 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico.

So, here's the thing.
The Right, in many countries across the world, are using stochastic terrorism as weapons to destabilize each nation they supposedly represent.  They bask in the idea of paying the progressive people back, starting with social murder and expanding from there.
 People who were once friends feel like victims because they feel oppressed for not being able to act maliciously to others. People who own multiple properties,  with multi million dollar homes at lake lots, complaining of how unfair things are because of environmental issues,  education,  lgbtq,  the disabled and homeless.  Becoming outrageously angry at the thought that they are being victimized by these groups.
I've heard the calling for violence from people I used to respect and call friends, Celebrating the murder of autistic people by law enforcement.  Voicing an eagerness to see more.  
 The American and Canadian Right are both shifting to more extreme politics, and they are dragging their base right along with them.

Yes. Absolutely.  I know many who would live to kill someone because the Right have told them that many of their fellow citizens are their enemy.

Lower the temperature of water from 0.000001 C to 0.0000001 C and it is still liquid water. Then lower the temperature again the same fraction of a degree and it has a profound change of state from a liquid to a solid. Not only that, but the density of the solid is less(!!!!!) than the density of the liquid, allowing life to survive on our planet.

Another really fascinating phase transition is from a normal metal to a superconductor. Lowering the temperature of certain metals, which have resistance (albeit small) to the flow of electrons (electrical current) can result in a phase transition to a zero resistance superconductor state. Not close to zero resistance, but actually exactly zero resistance. 

When physicists do their physicist things, they can treat our transition from the Holocene Era to the Anthropocene Era as a phase transition.

As a result, they build theoretical models to study this transition, and these models build on superconductor models using Logistic Maps, lots of impressive equations, and something called Ginsburg-Landau theory.

What they find is that it is theoretically possible for the climate state of the Earth to transition from our present state to a state of utter chaotic behaviour; literally a state of chaos.

We probably don’t want this to happen, but that seems to be where we are headed.

&gt;MADRID, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Temperatures across Spain smashed records for December as a mass of hot air swept over the Iberian Peninsula on Tuesday, pushing the mercury close to 30 degrees Celsius (86 Fahrenheit) in the south and delaying the start of the ski season.  
&gt;  
&gt;While the Northern Hemisphere gears up for the arrival of winter, Spaniards' hopes of a ""white"" Christmas are waning after a summer with four heatwaves amidst the hottest year on record, part of a global pattern of rising temperatures that is widely attributed by scientists to human activity.  
&gt;  
&gt;""It's one of the warmest masses of air to have ever overflown Spain at this point in December,"" Ruben del Campo, a spokesperson for the national weather agency AEMET, said.  
&gt;  
&gt;Del Campo pointed to cities on the sunny Mediterranean coast such as Valencia, which recorded temperatures of at least 27C, two degrees higher than the previous record for the last month of the year.  
&gt;  
&gt;He added that the unseasonable heat, coupled with predictions of sparse rainfall until the end of February, heralded a ""not very good"" season for winter sports that depend on abundant snow, which once melted is also a crucial water resource for the spring and summer months.  
&gt;  
&gt;The exceptional warmth is likely to end after Wednesday when AEMET forecasts cooler air from higher latitudes will bring temperatures down to more normal values for December.  
&gt;  
&gt;At the popular ski resort of Navacerrada outside Madrid, visitors bemoaned the lack of snow.  
&gt;  
&gt;""It's a terrifying feeling because this should really be covered in snow or frozen over, but instead it's green and lush for this time of the year,"" Tania, a 32-year-old marine biologist who only gave her first name, told Reuters.  
&gt;  
&gt;Vicente Solsona, a 66-year-old retired university professor from eastern Castellon province, said that Navacerrada should have at least one metre (3.3 feet) of snow on such a date.  
&gt;  
&gt;""We're calmly destroying everything,"" he added. ""The problem is that there's no going back.""

I’m talking toxic air, the Berkeley pit which people periodically would fall and practically disintegrate, poisoned drinking water, loss of local ecosystems ranging a from both flora and fauna and more. It wasn’t until some serious environmental crack downs happened and some major accountability took place before change started happening. 

Especially for the Berkeley pit which still exists and is currently getting worked on and cleaned by the EPA. I first visited Montana when I was in the foster system around 2014, the pit was a deep dark red color and smelled horrible. It was also pretty deep and wide if I recall correctly. I visited again in 2018 and the pit was no longer smelly, the water level was lower and the water was a lot cleaner. Still murky, but very much cleaner. 

This town is why I still hold hope for climate change to have a positive turn around. Butte Montana was literally corrupt, and 100s upon 100s of people lost their lives, and millions were affected by the impacts of the ones running the operations, healthwise and more. 

They have a whole museum dedicated to the 150+ year industrialization and its consequences. 

The stark contrast between the photos of Buttes industrialization and mining operations — and their consequences on the environment compared to now give me hope. The fact that they as a community rose up and fought for change. And made it *happen.*

That’s what it’ll take. And I’m hopeful because now we’re collectively talking about climate change. Even the rich and powerful that denied and denied and denied for almost 100 years, maybe even more. They’re talking about it *now.* this is progress.

Lower the temperature of water from 0.000001 C to 0.0000001 C and it is still liquid water. Then lower the temperature again the same fraction of a degree and it has a profound change of state from a liquid to a solid. Not only that, but the density of the solid is less(!!!!!) than the density of the liquid, allowing life to survive on our planet.

Another really fascinating phase transition is from a normal metal to a superconductor. Lowering the temperature of certain metals, which have resistance (albeit small) to the flow of electrons (electrical current) can result in a phase transition to a zero resistance superconductor state. Not close to zero resistance, but actually exactly zero resistance. 

When physicists do their physicist things, they can treat our transition from the Holocene Era to the Anthropocene Era as a phase transition.

As a result, they build theoretical models to study this transition, and these models build on superconductor models using Logistic Maps, lots of impressive equations, and something called Ginsburg-Landau theory.

What they find is that it is theoretically possible for the climate state of the Earth to transition from our present state to a state of utter chaotic behaviour; literally a state of chaos.

We probably don’t want this to happen, but that seems to be where we are headed.

I feel like this must be a fairly common encounter these days, but for any who haven’t seen - there’s a type of online personality who dedicate their presence to stating that human induced climate change is now beyond our control. I’ve seen many on twitter, they will often go as far as to say that any effort to mitigate global warming is (at this stage) pointless. 
This is usually hinged on ideas/statements such as ‘it’s physically impossible to remove enough CO² on a short enough timescale to save humankind’, or (one I read today) “There is no scenario that results in lower CO² levels in the atmosphere. Not one. This is a certainty of physics.”. The other most common one is about the cooling effect of particulate pollutants currently mitigating some of the warming, arguing that reducing emissions now would actually cause MORE warming! 
I know it comes off as fairly hyperbolic, but I’m trying to be sceptical in all directions! I see the work of James Hansen held up as evidence quite often and I’ve read about some of the problems with some of his claims, but don’t think I’ve read comprehensive rebuttals of all his main points. 
Im hoping someone can talk broadly to the legitimacy of these kind of claims, particularly from a physics point of view. I’d also love to be directed to trusted research that proposes mitigation methods.

Thanks in advance.

This paper importantly confirms the recent work and letters of James Hansen and his research team.

New paper press release:
Cleanup of air pollution heats the Earth
https://cicero.oslo.no/en/articles/cleanup-of-air-pollution-heats-the-earth

“Recent reductions in emissions of tiny particles, the major cause of air pollution globally, have led to more heat in the Earth’s climate system. This is shown in a new international study led by CICERO and published in Nature Communications Earth &amp; Environment.”

“Satellite measurements clearly show that more heat is entering the Earth’s atmosphere from the Sun compared to the amount of terrestrial energy escaping to space. This so-called Earth energy imbalance leads to accumulation of heat and warming of the Earth’s surface.

It is well known that man-made emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases have been the major cause of global warming in recent decades, and that emissions of particles have masked part of this warming. Most of the particles, especially sulphate, reflect sunlight and therefore act to cool the planet. In the last couple of decades, however, this cooling effect has reversed and now contributes to a warming due to extensive measures to improve air quality in many regions worldwide.”

Peer-reviewed scientific paper:
Recent reductions in aerosol emissions have increased Earth’s energy imbalance
https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-024-01324-8.pdf


“Abstract

The Earth’s energy imbalance is the net radiative flux at the top-of-atmosphere. Climate model simulations suggest that the observed positive imbalance trend in the previous two decades is inconsistent with internal variability alone and caused by anthropogenic forcing and the resulting climate system response. Here, we investigate anthropogenic contributions to the imbalance trend using climate models forced with observed sea-surface temperatures. We find that the effective radiative forcing due to anthropogenic aerosol emission reductions has led to a 0.2 ± 0.1 W m−2 decade−1 strengthening of the 2001–2019 imbalance trend. The multi-model ensemble reproduces the observed imbalance trend of 0.47 ± 0.17 W m−2 decade−1 but with 10-40% underestimation. With most future scenarios showing further rapid reductions of aerosol emissions due to air quality legislation, such emission reductions may continue to strengthen Earth’s energy imbalance, on top of the greenhouse gas contribution. Consequently, we may expect an accelerated surface temperature warming in this decade.”

As climate stress intensifies domestically, and the global economy gradually (or suddenly!) collapses from the compounded stress of polycrises like financial shock, frequent political  destabilization, and supply chain disruption, Americans will see their financial lives whither.  We have 40 years of evidence showing how relatively modest shrinking of the US middle class has allowed MAGA to blossom and Hitler-wannabe Trump to be a viable candidate. And that's just the warm up act.

Overt in-your-face fascism will spread and its recruiters will have easy pickings.   

It’s interesting that in the article it’s the economists warning about the risk to liberal democracy. 

Missing from this entire discussion is any mention that the problem of climate change is merely a symptom. A descent into the political abyss is inevitable unless we start addressing the root cause not just the symptom.  The root cause is that the modern global economy is built on the foundational principle of perpetual economic growth addiction (PEGA). 

PEGA has always been a Ponzi scheme. The first stirrings of widespread awareness that PEGA is a multi century Ponzi scheme that is coming to its natural conclusion is starting to emerge. In the 1990s I'd go months - sometimes years - without seeing anyone writing about this.  Now there are new articles every day. Those paying attention are starting to realize and talk about ourselves and our childern being the suckers left holding the bag. And even more of us around the world do not have the luxury to be reading and philosophizing.  We are quite *literally* holding the bag, of whatever we could salvage, as climate stress drives us from our homes.

As long as the leaders of these liberal democracies try to salvage the insane foundation of PEGA they will be unable to turn the tide and the existing world economic and political order will continue to disintegrate, increment by increment, puncuated by sudden shocks. 

But I’m not hearing anybody in positions of leadership calling for turning our backs on economic growth and embracing steady state economics. So the die appears to be cast.

We should still try to mitigate against even more climate change doing everything we should have done in the 1990s and the 2000s and the 20010s and we should get all of that done by 2026.  We do need Hope of course, but what we do not need is false hope. Real hope lies in identifying the actual underlying cause of the problem of climate change - Perpetual Economic Growth Addiction - not just trying to treat the symptom.  This is why all the ""Green Economy"" hype ultimately won't work - it's a new coat of paint on the same old Ponzi scheme.  The technologies are fine.  The fatal flaw is that the vision is still built on the insane delusion we can have PEGA on a finite planet.

Edit: this may be of interest

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Madrid_Seismic_Zone

&gt;In a report filed in November 2008, the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency warns that a serious earthquake in the NMSZ could result in ""the highest economic losses due to a natural disaster in the United States,"" further predicting ""widespread and catastrophic"" damage across Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas, and particularly Tennessee, where a 7.7 magnitude quake would cause damage to tens of thousands of structures affecting water distribution, transportation systems, and other vital infrastructure.[24] The earthquake is expected to result in many thousands of fatalities, with more than 4,000 of the fatalities expected in Memphis alone.

&gt;The potential for the recurrence of large earthquakes and their effects today on densely populated cities in and around the seismic zone has generated much research devoted to understanding the NMSZ. By studying evidence of past quakes and closely monitoring ground motion and current earthquake activity, scientists attempt to understand their causes and recurrence intervals.

&gt;In October 2009, a team composed of University of Illinois and Virginia Tech researchers headed by Amr S. Elnashai, funded by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, considered a scenario where all three segments of the New Madrid fault ruptured simultaneously with a total earthquake magnitude of 7.7. The report found that there would be significant damage in the eight states studied – Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, and Tennessee – with the probability of additional damage in states farther from the NMSZ. Tennessee, Arkansas, and Missouri would be most severely impacted, and Memphis and St. Louis would be severely damaged. The report estimated 86,000 casualties, including 3,500 fatalities, 715,000 damaged buildings, and 7.2 million people displaced, with two million of those seeking shelter, primarily due to the lack of utility services. Direct economic losses, according to the report, would be at least $300 billion.[25]",climate,2024-04-03 17:00:54,1buv5e5,Infamous_Employer_85,0,1,0,True,2023-01-03 06:04:33,46.0,0.0,745.0,30694.0,31485.0,150,,I came across a compilation of U.S. cities facing the most significant flood risks.

473882,k6by9gi,9,"I think a lot of the blame for our lack of response to the climate crisis *can* be attributed to our overvaluing of economic analysis, though. Climate scientists are naturally reserved when presenting their findings, highlighting limitations, caveats, and uncertainties for their work. While this is how scientific findings should be presented, it makes it easier for politicians and the public to dismiss the results and leads to inaction. 

Economists do this too, though to a lesser extent, and yet their word is often taken without a second thought. Economic metrics are the only thing people in power care about. They don’t care about the Antarctic melting, coral reefs collapsing, or the Amazon burning, just how much is it gonna cost. But the estimates economists give them should have even more uncertainty associated with them than the predictions made by climate scientists. They really have no idea how climate change could impact the economy and yet they are the ones directing policy (or the lack thereof). 

This has caused real harm. The underestimation of climate impacts by economists directly led to US inaction in the 80s and 90s. Nathaniel Rich’s “Losing Earth” outlines this well and I highly recommend people read it.

It’s incredibly frustrating as a scientist to see governments only listen to economists on this, when their methodology and models pale in comparison to the physics-based climate models (which are nowhere close to be being perfect themselves).

451083,k8yn3cf,1,"&gt;That happens a lot with companies, but tracking global fossil fuel consumption is relatively easy. I haven't seen any dispute about these numbers, have you?

No but emissions are not the same as consumption. Emissions depend on the efficiency of the processes which can be different between the processes and different from what companies estimate emissions from the processes.

&gt;I've seen more uncertainty about the emissions related to land use change.

I don't know a lot about that but I would think that is true. I've also read that the oceans and plants decrease their ability to absorb CO2 as the concentrations get higher. Maybe that is already happening and we haven't taking any of that into account yet. 

&gt;I'm not sure I understand your comment. Global emissions (from human activities) haven't decreased yet.

The disconnect is that you are talking about emissions and I am talking about CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere. [Here](https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/mlo.html) is a plot of CO2 concentrations historically. You can see there was no drop in the increase in CO2 concentrations even during covid when emissions were reported as actually decreasing due to low economic activity.

&gt;My source says 2.7C. Where are you getting 3.6C?

I'm saying if you take the data from the plot shown in the link I just posted and project that curve out to the year 2100 you get enough CO2 PPM concentrations in the atmosphere that would raise the temperature to 3.6C above pre-industrial temperatures. Does that explain what I'm talking about?

&gt;We can anticipate this change by analyzing public policies, technological improvements, demographics etc. Global CO2 emissions are expected to peak quite soon, and they are already going down in many places.

I hope that is correct. But everything I've been reading lately is the opposite as oil companies are planning more exploration and extractions and developing countries are delaying when they plan on starting to cut back. As you may know their argument is they want the same lifestyle as the developed countries and think it's the developed countries responsibility to cut back since they are the ones that have put all the CO2 in the atmosphere up to this point, so now it's the underdeveloped countries turn to prosper using fossil fuels.",climate,2023-11-12 18:56:40,17t0m8r,Tpaine63,0,1,0,True,2019-12-25 13:30:22,24.0,0.0,6041.0,7914.0,13979.0,990,,France's Macron says melting glaciers are 'an unprecedented challenge for humanity',0.98,990,0,2023-11-11 18:35:30,"['CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere are increasing, despite reported decreases in emissions.', 'The rate of increase in CO2 concentrations is not decreasing, even during periods of low economic activity.', 'The projected temperature increase by 2100 is expected to be 3.6C above pre-industrial temperatures.', 'Global CO2 emissions are expected to peak soon and decline in many places.', 'However, there is a disconnect between emissions and CO2 concentrations, and the latter is a more accurate indicator of climate change.', ""The developed countries' responsibility to cut back on emissions is being disputed by developing countries, who argue they should be allowed to prosper using fossil fuels.""]"

I feel like this must be a fairly common encounter these days, but for any who haven’t seen - there’s a type of online personality who dedicate their presence to stating that human induced climate change is now beyond our control. I’ve seen many on twitter, they will often go as far as to say that any effort to mitigate global warming is (at this stage) pointless. 
This is usually hinged on ideas/statements such as ‘it’s physically impossible to remove enough CO² on a short enough timescale to save humankind’, or (one I read today) “There is no scenario that results in lower CO² levels in the atmosphere. Not one. This is a certainty of physics.”. The other most common one is about the cooling effect of particulate pollutants currently mitigating some of the warming, arguing that reducing emissions now would actually cause MORE warming! 
I know it comes off as fairly hyperbolic, but I’m trying to be sceptical in all directions! I see the work of James Hansen held up as evidence quite often and I’ve read about some of the problems with some of his claims, but don’t think I’ve read comprehensive rebuttals of all his main points. 
Im hoping someone can talk broadly to the legitimacy of these kind of claims, particularly from a physics point of view. I’d also love to be directed to trusted research that proposes mitigation methods.

Thanks in advance.

279856,kk2jsgg,1,"Jay,

Humor me for a moment, as I would like constructive feedback on my thought process.  Assume the disks that are the base component of the system - have:

1. An LCD like coating that can be dynamically changed from very high to very low albedo. A transceiver that allows you to remotely control their ""reflect/absorb"" pattern.  This will let you easily control their orientation to the Sun - from parallel to perpendicular and anywhere in between.  They would have 2 degrees of freedom - one rotating around the X axis, the other around the Y axis. This would let us tilt them in a way that ""sails"" them North, South, East or West - with regard to their position above the Earth. 
2. If they have a sufficiently low mass/area ratio - can they not be ""steered"" like a proper light sail?  If we ""sail"" them around in a radial area that is just inside L1 - where the light pressure on them - when fully parallel - is enough to push them towards Earth - and the X/Y axis controls lets you move them around sort of in relation to Earth's Lat/Long.    
3. I ""think"" L1 - for a big area, would be a bit concave towards the Earth - does that seem right.    

Let's imagine that the components of the system are disks - maybe made of aluminum alloy as the moon has a LOT of aluminum.  We make them as thin as possible without losing their rigidity.  I am not a mech engineer - but one option is to have an outer structural ring a few mms in diameter and then the remaining surface be lightly tensioned - but really really thin - like aluminum foil.

I feel like this must be a fairly common encounter these days, but for any who haven’t seen - there’s a type of online personality who dedicate their presence to stating that human induced climate change is now beyond our control. I’ve seen many on twitter, they will often go as far as to say that any effort to mitigate global warming is (at this stage) pointless. 
This is usually hinged on ideas/statements such as ‘it’s physically impossible to remove enough CO² on a short enough timescale to save humankind’, or (one I read today) “There is no scenario that results in lower CO² levels in the atmosphere. Not one. This is a certainty of physics.”. The other most common one is about the cooling effect of particulate pollutants currently mitigating some of the warming, arguing that reducing emissions now would actually cause MORE warming! 
I know it comes off as fairly hyperbolic, but I’m trying to be sceptical in all directions! I see the work of James Hansen held up as evidence quite often and I’ve read about some of the problems with some of his claims, but don’t think I’ve read comprehensive rebuttals of all his main points. 
Im hoping someone can talk broadly to the legitimacy of these kind of claims, particularly from a physics point of view. I’d also love to be directed to trusted research that proposes mitigation methods.

*In 1960-1970 the growth rate was slightly less than about 1 ppm/y, but the growth-rate has been steadily increasing, reaching 2.47±0.25 ppm/y (mean ± 2 std dev) in the middle of 2023. This means that currently, the concentration of carbon dioxide is growing by about 2.47 ppm per year.*

*So, what does the data tell us? It shows that all is not well in the state of the atmosphere! In order to prevent further warming, the carbon dioxide levels must not grow any further. On the growth curve, this corresponds the curve having to settle down to 0 ppm/y. There is absolutely no hint in the data that this is happening. On the contrary, the rate of growth is itself growing, having now reached about 2.47 ppm/y the highest growth rate ever seen in modern times. This is not just a ""business as usual"" scenario, it is worse than that, we're actually moving backward, becoming more and more unsustainable with every year.

Global warming in the pipeline is greater than prior estimates. Eventual global warming due to today's GHG forcing alone -- after slow feedbacks operate -- is about 10°C.

I am not sure what I can add, if there is a lack of understanding on how the CURRENT EMITTED GHGs will lead to an inevitable 10C temp rise, there not much I can add.

We really aren’t meaningfully slowing emissions ergo the worst case IPCC scenario doesn’t seem unlikely. And as things are unfolding scientists seem to be learning of the importance and sensitivity various feedback loops that may indicates things unfold faster than expected. 

I think where the reasonable arguments are to be had about us not slowing warming are due to ecological trends of overconsumption , and how human nature interplays with the environment.

Lower the temperature of water from 0.000001 C to 0.0000001 C and it is still liquid water. Then lower the temperature again the same fraction of a degree and it has a profound change of state from a liquid to a solid. Not only that, but the density of the solid is less(!!!!!) than the density of the liquid, allowing life to survive on our planet.

Another really fascinating phase transition is from a normal metal to a superconductor. Lowering the temperature of certain metals, which have resistance (albeit small) to the flow of electrons (electrical current) can result in a phase transition to a zero resistance superconductor state. Not close to zero resistance, but actually exactly zero resistance. 

When physicists do their physicist things, they can treat our transition from the Holocene Era to the Anthropocene Era as a phase transition.

As a result, they build theoretical models to study this transition, and these models build on superconductor models using Logistic Maps, lots of impressive equations, and something called Ginsburg-Landau theory.

What they find is that it is theoretically possible for the climate state of the Earth to transition from our present state to a state of utter chaotic behaviour; literally a state of chaos.

We probably don’t want this to happen, but that seems to be where we are headed.

There were a bunch of climate models in CMIP6(a set of models used in IPCC 6th assessment report) that showed a climate sensitivity similar to what is claimed in this study(up to 5.6c), way higher than the range from previous reports. However, scientists who worked on them and the report found that these models overestimate future warming(conclusion was based on paleoclimate data and other lines of evidence) and narrowed the range used in the report down to 2.5-4c, so actual ECS ending up beyond that range is not very likely.

Trump has been laundering money for the Russian oligarchs since the late 80’s when they all bought a condo at 725 5th ave (trump towers) to clean their freshly stolen USSR money after the iron curtain fell.

https://www.cnn.com/cnn/2019/05/30/politics/paul-manafort-condo-trump-tower/index.html

Everybody except Putin thought the Cold War was over. Trump and Manafort (who lived in the tower also) just saw a pretty low maintence grift to be had.

Trump had actually been Manafort and Roger stones first client at their lobbyist firm (1980)

https://en.m.wikipedia.org › wikiBlack, Manafort, Stone and Kelly

Guiliani as trumps attorney and New Yorks mayor was able to redirect NYPD investigations onto rival gang members/oligarchs to deflect any scrutiny off of trump, himself or the Russian connections.

https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2023/09/a-new-rudy-scandal-fbi-agent-says-giuliani-was-co-opted-by-russian-intelligence/

The Russian election interference in 2016 was effectively a generation 3 version of what Manafort had done in the Philippines, then keeping Yanukovych in power as Putin’s puppet in Ukraine from 2002-14 when Maidan ran both Yanukovych and Manafort out of Ukraine as Ukrainians realized that, if you raise your lens high enough, corruption is an wholly unsustainable business model.

Eventually the parasites greed always consumes the host.

https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/06/2016-donald-trump-paul-manafort-ferinand-marcos-philippines-1980s-213952

Russia greatly underestimated the addictive properties of freedom when it invaded Ukraine so what was supposed to be a 3-10 day coup turned into a 2 year fight for the Ukrainians right not to be genocided.

Russia depleted  its weapons stocks which were already the victim of vranyos corruption because every oligarch, admiral and sergeant in the Russian military is on the take.  Every billion dollar tank maintenance contract turned into everything getting a spray paint overhaul and the vast majority of the redirected funds turned into an oligarchs new yacht or home in Aspen.

Russia was forced to turn to China, North Korea and Iran for weapons because if they lose the 3-10 day special military operation in Ukraine the Russian empire is dead and cold.

China can’t risk showing their involvement in the Ukraine war so they use North Korea, and Iran to resupply Russia.

Russia previously owed Iran some undelivered fighter jets that are already smoldering heaps in Ukraine so Iran now had the upper hand at the negotiation table for the first time in about 60 years. They supply Russia with shahed drones in exchange for Chinas material support against their sworn religious enemy, Israel.

https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2023/11/29/iran-says-it-finalized-deal-to-buy-russian-aircraft/

Putin can’t do much about it because he is slowly realizing that by setting the standard of corruption and stealing $200+ billion from his own people meant that every oligarch down in the mob model chain had not only permission but incentive and the expectation to steal from him as well. This is Vranyos. 

The mob model only works if the supreme leader is the most violent and can prove it without exception every damn day. But violence is exceptionally expensive when you are trying to present as a legitimate government or business. 

If Russia as a nation had an efficiency rating it would have been banned for sale in the state of California 25 years ago.

The parasite ruling class stole all the energy out of the working class and collapsed it.

Now Iran has the high hand and they get the intelligence that trump passed to Putin about the fact that Netanyahu cares far less about Jews, Palestinians or genocide than he does about remaining in power as an authoritarian because he too has developed Ritz Carlton tastes and his own corruption trial is showing the same tendrils of the money laundering scheme that trumps trials are.

They all hate each other but because they share the same money laundry, if one falls, they all fall. Hamas minted a couple billionaires as well that live in penthouses  in Qatar and get 30% of everything smuggled into Gaza.  Netanyahu needs a bogeyman to stay in power. That’s why he coordinates with Hamas via Russia via Iran. https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bk8mgcefr

Iran handed Hamas everything they needed with Chinas help as secret Santa and the Russian intelligence given to them by the eternal shitbird trump when he gave it to his Russians kleptocrat/friends/roommates from the old days of fucking each others wives at trump towers in the 90’s.

Now the MAGA right is a little too invested in their reality that they are the good guys with guns that they missed the fact that Betsy  DeVos (erik princes sister) decimating the U.S. school systems and the Kochs poisoning children with lead was not a coincidence.  The naive right was the mark all along. There is a reason the Russian spy Maria Butina landed in South Dakota first before dating her way to the top of the NRA which is undergoing its own Russian money laundering trial now. Russia was tinder matching the GOP.

The only reason you grossly  OVERVALUE real estate is money laundering.

Trump keeps claiming there is no victim, all the banks made money, but if their plan succeeds the Russian and CCP kleptocrats collapse US commercial real estate and basically recreate soviet perestroika in the U.S. so they can foreclose on America and buy everything for 3 cents on the dollar with the $1.4T they stole from Russias grandmothers in the first place

It’s the evolution of grift. Soviet perestroika cross bred with the 2008 mortgage crisis. 

This is just the bigger badder commercial strength bastard child of the two. 

Trump, Putin, Bolsonaro, Netanyahu, Orban, Manafort, Stone, Mercer, Bannon, Flynn, Byrne.

You're wrong


That index you are referring to is about vertebrate populations, not wildlife in general, vertebrates are a tiny fraction of Earth's biomass. https://ourworldindata.org/life-on-earth




moreover-




“In the last 50 years, Earth has lost 68% of wildlife, all thanks to us humans” (India Times)“Humanity has wiped out 60% of animal populations since 1970, report finds” (The Guardian)“We’ve lost 60% of wildlife in less than 50 years” (World Economic Forum)These are just three of many headlines covering the Living Planet Index. But they are all wrong. They are based on a misunderstanding of what the Living Planet Index shows.




https://ourworldindata.org/living-planet-index-decline - explainer article from ourworldindata""




Recent analyses have reported catastrophic global declines in vertebrate populations. However, the distillation of many trends into a global mean index obscures the variation that can inform conservation measures and can be sensitive to analytical decisions. For example, previous analyses have estimated a mean vertebrate decline of more than 50% since 1970 (Living Planet Index).Here we show, however, that this estimate is driven by less than 3% of vertebrate populations; if these extremely declining populations are excluded, the global trend switches to an increase. The sensitivity of global mean trends to outliers suggests that more informative indices are needed. We propose an alternative approach, which identifies clusters of extreme decline (or increase) that differ statistically from the majority of population trends.We show that, of taxonomic–geographic systems in the Living Planet Index, 16 systems contain clusters of extreme decline (comprising around 1% of populations; these extreme declines occur disproportionately in larger animals) and 7 contain extreme increases (around 0.4% of populations). The remaining 98.6% of populations across all systems showed no mean global trend.""

Here is a [**fact sheet**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/06/fact-sheet-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-deal/) published by the White House.

[**Here's**](https://www.investopedia.com/here-s-what-s-in-the-usd1-trillion-infrastructure-bill-passed-by-the-senate-5196817) another explanation - its down a little on the page, and also includes BBB's contents. I'll paste it below:

&gt; $110 billion for roads and bridges. In addition to construction and repair, the funding also helps pay for transportation research at universities, funding for Puerto Rico’s highways, and “congestion relief” in American cities.

&gt; $66 billion for railroads. Funding includes upgrades and maintenance of America’s passenger rail system and freight rail safety, but nothing for high-speed rail.

&gt; $65 billion for the power grid. The bill would fund updates to power lines and cables, as well as provide money to prevent hacking of the power grid. Clean energy funding is also included.

&gt; $65 billion for broadband. Includes funding to expand broadband in rural areas and in low-income communities. Approximately $14 billion of the total would help reduce Internet bills for low-income citizens.

&gt; $55 billion for water infrastructure. This funding includes $15 billion for lead pipe replacement, $10 billion for chemical cleanup, and money to provide clean drinking water in tribal communities.

&gt; $47 billion for cybersecurity and climate change. The Resilience Fund will protect infrastructure from cybersecurity attacks and address flooding, wildfires, coastal erosion, and droughts along with other extreme weather events.

&gt; $39 billion for public transit. Funding here provides for upgrades to public transit systems nationwide. The allocation also includes money to create new bus routes and help make public transit more accessible to seniors and disabled Americans.

&gt; $25 billion for airports. This allocation provides funding for major upgrades and expansions at U.S. airports. Air traffic control towers and systems would receive $5 billion of the total for upgrades.

&gt; $21 billion for the environment. These monies would be used to clean up superfund and brownfield sites, abandoned mines, and old oil and gas wells.

&gt; $17 billion for ports. Half of the funds in this category would go to the Army Corps of Engineers for port infrastructure. Additional funds would go to the Coast Guard, ferry terminals, and reduction of truck emissions at ports.

&gt; $11 billion for safety. Appropriations here are to address highway, pedestrian, pipeline, and other safety areas with highway safety getting the bulk of the funding.

&gt; $8 billion for western water infrastructure. Ongoing drought conditions in the western half of the country will be addressed through investments in water treatment, storage, and reuse facilities.

&gt; $7.5 bill for electric vehicle charging stations. The Biden administration asked for this funding to build significantly more charging stations for electric vehicles across the nation.

&gt; $7.5 billion for electric school buses. With an emphasis on bus fleet replacement in low-income, rural, and tribal communities, this funding is expected to allow those communities to convert to zero-emission buses.",climate,2024-01-24 01:32:36,19dplky,jattyrr,0,1,0,False,,2584.0,487.0,0.0,0.0,3071.0,448,,"Haley Is More Climate Conscious Than Trump—Which Isn’t Saying Much | She admits warming is real, but is still all in on fossil fuels.",0.95,448,0,2024-01-23 14:26:41,"[""The Biden administration's infrastructure deal is a significant investment in climate change initiatives."", 'The deal includes a range of funding for various projects, including renewable energy, green infrastructure, and environmental conservation.', 'The author appears to be neutral in their assessment, presenting facts and figures without expressing a clear opinion.', ""The deal's focus on climate change is seen as a positive step towards addressing the issue.""]"

413966,kbfonof,2,"As [COP28 began](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/11/30/cop28-climate-summit-dubai-begins/?itid=lk_inline_manual_2), the World Meteorological Organization confirmed what appeared to be a foregone conclusion: that 2023 is assured to end up as Earth’s hottest year in human history.

It will break a record set in 2016, underscoring that the world is closer than ever to the global warming thresholds that global leaders are seeking to avoid. Data from January through October shows the planet is likely to average 1.3 degrees Celsius to 1.5 degrees Celsius above a preindustrial norm this year, the WMO said.

Constraining global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels [is the world’s most important climate goal](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2022/global-warming-1-5-celsius-scenarios/?itid=lk_inline_manual_5). Scientists say it is becoming increasingly out of reach but that achieving it would [save coral reefs](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2023/08/09/florida-coral-bleaching-ocean-temperature/?itid=lk_inline_manual_5), preserve polar ice and prevent dramatic sea-level rise. (Such warmth would need to sustain for years and decades at a time to face the worst consequences.)

Petteri Taalas, the organization’s secretary general, stressed that this year’s warming has had real-life harms around the world and pushed the planet to new weather and climate extremes.

“Greenhouse gas levels are record high. Global temperatures are record high. Sea level rise is record high. Antarctic sea ice is record low,” he said in a statement. “It’s a deafening cacophony of broken records.”

Taalas and United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said the data should incite urgency in the global leaders convening in Dubai, and remind them there is still hope that climate goals can be reached.

“We have the roadmap to limit the rise in global temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius and avoid the worst of climate chaos. But we need leaders to fire the starting gun at COP28 on a race to keep the 1.5 degree limit alive,” Guterres said in a video message that played during the U.N. climate conference in Dubai.
