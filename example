287736	kjd8hls	5	The writers idea that we will band together to cooperate as things get that bad, instead of breaking into isolationist groups in the grip of their respective authoritarian regimes is indeed optimistic.  Before there were research rules on how we treat animals social scientists set up a laboratory environment for rats where they had plenty of room, and all of their needs were met, and the rats were happy.  Gradually the researchers increased the population of rats in the fixed environment. Oh there was plenty of food and water. It just got more crowded.  Eventually, the rats turned cannibal and ate each other.  I do have optimism for the future that might emerge out of such a dystopia.  I just think we are not going to see the light until it gets very very dark. UNLESS college educated people stop making their retirement plans, their top priority, and are willing to fill the jails by committing themselves to civil disobedience, but that’s not going to happen anytime soon.  Or it might be enough enough if such people quit focusing on financial advancement, and instead committed their life and their money to replacing Congress with sensible people, but that doesn’t appear to be happening  either. Take any prior election and the commitment of most college educated voters and multiply that level of commitment by at least 50. That’s the kind of thing I’m talking about.  Since the college educated voters with good jobs are not putting that kind of skin in the game we are left with the default  Plan B….

473882	k6by9gi	9	"I think a lot of the blame for our lack of response to the climate crisis *can* be attributed to our overvaluing of economic analysis, though. Climate scientists are naturally reserved when presenting their findings, highlighting limitations, caveats, and uncertainties for their work. While this is how scientific findings should be presented, it makes it easier for politicians and the public to dismiss the results and leads to inaction. 

Economists do this too, though to a lesser extent, and yet their word is often taken without a second thought. Economic metrics are the only thing people in power care about. They don’t care about the Antarctic melting, coral reefs collapsing, or the Amazon burning, just how much is it gonna cost. But the estimates economists give them should have even more uncertainty associated with them than the predictions made by climate scientists. They really have no idea how climate change could impact the economy and yet they are the ones directing policy (or the lack thereof).

206427	ktwt9tk	1	"Butte Montana actually has substantial climate data. They destroyed their ecosystem due to unregulated mining from the 1800s to about mid or late 1950s. 

I’m talking toxic air, the Berkeley pit which people periodically would fall and practically disintegrate, poisoned drinking water, loss of local ecosystems ranging a from both flora and fauna and more. It wasn’t until some serious environmental crack downs happened and some major accountability took place before change started happening. 

Especially for the Berkeley pit which still exists and is currently getting worked on and cleaned by the EPA. I first visited Montana when I was in the foster system around 2014, the pit was a deep dark red color and smelled horrible. It was also pretty deep and wide if I recall correctly. I visited again in 2018 and the pit was no longer smelly, the water level was lower and the water was a lot cleaner. Still murky, but very much cleaner. 

This town is why I still hold hope for climate change to have a positive turn around. Butte Montana was literally corrupt, and 100s upon 100s of people lost their lives, and millions were affected by the impacts of the ones running the operations, healthwise and more. 

They have a whole museum dedicated to the 150+ year industrialization and its consequences. 

The stark contrast between the photos of Buttes industrialization and mining operations — and their consequences on the environment compared to now give me hope. The fact that they as a community rose up and fought for change. And made it *happen.*

That’s what it’ll take. And I’m hopeful because now we’re collectively talking about climate change. Even the rich and powerful that denied and denied and denied for almost 100 years, maybe even more. They’re talking about it *now.* this is progress. Their gaslighting (hahahaha puns) is directly correlated to their guilt, obviously, and *NOW* they’re bringing it up in conversation.

*If you have a household income of $130,000 after tax and you’ve got a partner and one kid, you’re also in the richest 1 percent.*

Many startling facts are revealed in this report: essentially the super rich 1% are responsible for 16% of global emissions, equivalent to the emissions of the poorest 66% of people (5 billion people) on the planet. How does this sound for inequality? 

It’s mind-boggling. 

This report was just released within the flurry of reports coming out just prior to the COP28 conference in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. It is very sobering. Yet, it also shows how significant a return to some semblance of equality would put a dent in our abruptly changing climate system predicament.

451083	k8yn3cf	1	"&gt;That happens a lot with companies, but tracking global fossil fuel consumption is relatively easy. I haven't seen any dispute about these numbers, have you?

No but emissions are not the same as consumption. Emissions depend on the efficiency of the processes which can be different between the processes and different from what companies estimate emissions from the processes.

&gt;I've seen more uncertainty about the emissions related to land use change.

I don't know a lot about that but I would think that is true. I've also read that the oceans and plants decrease their ability to absorb CO2 as the concentrations get higher. Maybe that is already happening and we haven't taking any of that into account yet. 

&gt;I'm not sure I understand your comment. Global emissions (from human activities) haven't decreased yet.

The disconnect is that you are talking about emissions and I am talking about CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere. [Here](https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/mlo.html) is a plot of CO2 concentrations historically. You can see there was no drop in the increase in CO2 concentrations even during covid when emissions were reported as actually decreasing due to low economic activity.

&gt;My source says 2.7C. Where are you getting 3.6C?

I'm saying if you take the data from the plot shown in the link I just posted and project that curve out to the year 2100 you get enough CO2 PPM concentrations in the atmosphere that would raise the temperature to 3.6C above pre-industrial temperatures. Does that explain what I'm talking about?

&gt;We can anticipate this change by analyzing public policies, technological improvements, demographics etc. Global CO2 emissions are expected to peak quite soon, and they are already going down in many places.

I hope that is correct. But everything I've been reading lately is the opposite as oil companies are planning more exploration and extractions and developing countries are delaying when they plan on starting to cut back. As you may know their argument is they want the same lifestyle as the developed countries and think it's the developed countries responsibility to cut back since they are the ones that have put all the CO2 in the atmosphere up to this point, so now it's the underdeveloped countries turn to prosper using fossil fuels."	climate	2023-11-12 18:56:40	17t0m8r	Tpaine63	0	1	0	True	2019-12-25 13:30:22	24.0	0.0	6041.0	7914.0	13979.0	990		France's Macron says melting glaciers are 'an unprecedented challenge for humanity'	0.98	990	0	2023-11-11 18:35:30	"['Observes that tracking global fossil fuel consumption is relatively easy and not disputed.', 'Notes that emissions and consumption are not the same, and emissions depend on process efficiency.', 'Expresses uncertainty about emissions related to land use change.', 'Mentions that oceans and plants may decrease their ability to absorb CO2 as concentrations increase.', 'States that global emissions from human activities have not decreased yet.', 'Notes the disconnect between discussing emissions and CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere.', 'Provides a plot of CO2 concentrations historically and projects the curve to 2100, suggesting a temperature increase of 3.6C above pre-industrial temperatures.', 'Anticipates a change in CO2 emissions by analyzing public policies, technological improvements, demographics, etc.', 'States that global CO2 emissions are expected to peak soon and are already decreasing in many places.', ""Expresses skepticism about the accuracy of a source's claim of 2.7C temperature increase."", ""Cites oil companies' plans for more exploration and extraction, and developing countries' delay in cutting back on fossil fuels."", 'Mentions the argument that developed countries should cut back on CO2 emissions to allow underdeveloped countries to prosper using fossil fuels.']"

For example, raising temperatures enough to thaw permafrost, emitting tons of Methane into the atmosphere, raising the temperatures. This may cause melting of the polar caps/collapse of the polar jet stream, which will raise temperatures on average after the ice and polar air isn't contained. Following this, we may see the collapse of the Ocean currents with the deluge of freshwater, which will raise temperatures even more, collapse the ocean food chain, and probably result in another great mass extinction that will kill most large mammals and terrestrial life and a sizeable amount of ocean life, with the exception of some soecies of plants and animals in northern areas, and a prodigious amount of jellyfish and Deepwater organisms.

126111	kzrfljm	1	"It is easy to see how much energy it would take to remove CO2 from the air. There are roughly three ways in which the burning of fossil fuels emits usable energy. Heat, expansion and light. We hardly ever use all three. Cars for instance, only use the expansion, and the heat is cooled off with radiator with a fan in front of it. Oil lamps use the light. Coal electricity power plants use the heat. But when we want to remove CO2 and make another substance from it, we need to apply all these energies to it, also all the forms that were wasted when we used the energy that we wanted.

We could capture it, and put it in the ground where the natural gas used to be. But given how much methane leaks in the winning of natural gas, I highly doubt such a storage is safe.

34233	l5zvtht	4	"Humans need to reduce and stop using fossil fuels as soon as possible, within years, not decades, and start removing carbon from the atmosphere quickly. Even more pressing is the need to restore dwindling biodiversity, as [humans and domesticated animals currently make up 96% of mammalian biomass, leaving wild mammals at only 4%​](https://ourworldindata.org/wild-mammals-birds-biomass).

We need to create large forests, ideally at the [expense of the beef and sheep industries](https://ourworldindata.org/land-use-diets) that often lobby against such efforts. These forests should be old-growth, multi-layered, and rich in biodiversity—no monocultures. We should avoid large-scale logging and keep the forests as intact as possible, with minimal fragmentation from roads. Starting reforestation near the ocean and moving inland gradually will help reduce the need for irrigation.

We don't have a better tool in our arsenal to store a lot of carbon and reverse biodiversity loss than large, diverse forests.

This imbalance is caused by our diets; there's no way around it. Animal agriculture has historically been the biggest [driver of deforestation](https://ourworldindata.org/drivers-of-deforestation), and those [pastures are stolen land from wildlife](https://ourworldindata.org/land-use-diets).

Trump being terrible just makes people not want to vote for Trump, it doesn't make them vote for Biden. And for every person that despises Trump he has an enthusiastic supporter to make up for it.

Biden's approval rating has plummeted since and he's unlikely to win 2024 unless Trump is banned from running."	climate	2024-02-02 17:44:21	1ah4kn4	Cptn_Melvin_Seahorse	1	1	0	True	2023-07-26 16:07:46	0.0	0.0	51.0	1228.0	1279.0	337		'Reversed and scrubbed.'

295435	kis9vyz	1	"It's your misunderstanding of what the author claims a doomer is, is why I replied. Doomers and those through care to the wind are not the same. The author mentions:

-Climate Change Denialism

-Climate Change Optimism

-Climate Change Doomsayers

*And you created an unmentioned fourth*

-Climate Change Conceding

Doomsayers are *not* saying anything humans do won't matter. They are saying we are headed in a direction with results that will be worse because we are not doing enough. **They are not saying or encouraging anyone to give up.** Also, given that the author is a doomer, they clearly expressed their belief to **not give up.** That is the misinterpretation that's been made in those replies, (including your reply to mine). 

Whether you agree with the author about climate optimism, you don't understand what the author is *not saying* to give up what they've described, as they are a self proclaimed doomer. The author makes no statement to just let it happen. It's your definition of a doomer, not acceptance of the author's claim, that is the issue.
