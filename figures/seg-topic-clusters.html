      <td>[France's Macron says melting glaciers are 'an unprecedented challenge for humanity'&amp;gt;That happens a lot with companies, but tracking global fossil fuel consumption is relatively easy. I haven't seen any dispute about these numbers, have you?No but emissions are not the same as consumption. Emissions depend on the efficiency of the processes which can be different between the processes and different from what companies estimate emissions from the processes.&amp;gt;I've seen more uncertainty about the emissions related to land use change.I don't know a lot about that but I would think that is true. I've also read that the oceans and plants decrease their ability to absorb CO2 as the concentrations get higher. Maybe that is already happening and we haven't taking any of that into account yet. &amp;gt;I'm not sure I understand your comment. Global emissions (from human activities) haven't decreased yet.The disconnect is that you are talking about emissions and I am talking about CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere. [Here]( is a plot of CO2 concentrations historically. You can see there was no drop in the increase in CO2 concentrations even during covid when emissions were reported as actually decreasing due to low economic activity.&amp;gt;My source says 2.7C. Where are you getting 3.6C?I'm saying if you take the data from the plot shown in the link I just posted and project that curve out to the year 2100 you get enough CO2 PPM concentrations in the atmosphere that would raise the temperature to 3.6C above pre-industrial temperatures. Does that explain what I'm talking about?&amp;gt;We can anticipate this change by analyzing public policies, technological improvements, demographics etc., What Trump promised oil CEOs as he asked them to steer $1 billion to his campaign | Donald Trump has pledged to scrap President Bidens policies on electric vehicles and wind energy, as well as other initiatives opposed by the fossil fuel industry.Trump has been laundering money for the Russian oligarchs since the late 80s when they all bought a condo at 725 5th ave (trump towers) to clean their freshly stolen USSR money after the iron curtain fell. except Putin thought the Cold War was over. Trump and Manafort (who lived in the tower also) just saw a pretty low maintence grift to be had.Trump had actually been Manafort and Roger stones first client at their lobbyist firm (1980)  wikiBlack, Manafort, Stone and KellyGuiliani as trumps attorney and New Yorks mayor was able to redirect NYPD investigations onto rival gang members/oligarchs to deflect any scrutiny off of trump, himself or the Russian connections. Russian election interference in 2016 was effectively a generation 3 version of what Manafort had done in the Philippines, then keeping Yanukovych in power as Putins puppet in Ukraine from 2002-14 when Maidan ran both Yanukovych and Manafort out of Ukraine as Ukrainians realized that, if you raise your lens high enough, corruption is an wholly unsustainable business model.Eventually the parasites greed always consumes the host. greatly underestimated the addictive properties of freedom when it invaded Ukraine so what was supposed to be a 3-10 day coup turned into a 2 year fight for the Ukrainians right not to be genocided.Russia depleted  its weapons stocks which were already the victim of vranyos corruption because every oligarch, admiral and sergeant in the Russian military is on the take. Every billion dollar tank maintenance contract turned into everything getting a spray paint overhaul and the vast majority of the redirected funds turned into an oligarchs new yacht or home in Aspen.Russia was forced to turn to China, North Korea and Iran for weapons because if they lose the 3-10 day special military operation in Ukraine the Russian empire is dead and cold.China cant risk showing their involvement in the Ukraine war so they use North Korea, and Iran to resupply Russia.Russia previously owed Iran some undelivered fighter jets that are already smoldering heaps in Ukraine so Iran now had the upper hand at the negotiation table for the first time in about 60 years. They supply Russia with shahed drones in exchange for Chinas material support against their sworn religious enemy, Israel. cant do much about it because he is slowly realizing that by setting the standard of corruption and stealing $200+ billion from his own people meant that every oligarch down in the mob model chain had not only permission but incentive and the expectation to steal from him as well. This is Vranyos. The mob model only works if the supreme leader is the most violent and can prove it without exception every damn day. But violence is exceptionally expensive when you are trying to present as a legitimate government or business. If Russia as a nation had an efficiency rating it would have been banned for sale in the state of California 25 years ago.The parasite ruling class stole all the energy out of the working class and collapsed it.Now Iran has the high hand and they get the intelligence that trump passed to Putin about the fact that Netanyahu cares far less about Jews, Palestinians or genocide than he does about remaining in power as an authoritarian because he too has developed Ritz Carlton tastes and his own corruption trial is showing the same tendrils of the money laundering scheme that trumps trials are. Netanyahu:We Have Strong Influence over America ,We Control The Congress,The Senate, The LobbyThey all hate each other but because they share the same money laundry, if one falls, they all fall. Hamas minted a couple billionaires as well that live in penthouses  in Qatar and get 30% of everything smuggled into Gaza. Netanyahu needs a bogeyman to stay in power. Thats why he coordinates with Hamas via Russia via Iran. handed Hamas everything they needed with Chinas help as secret Santa and the Russian intelligence given to them by the eternal shitbird trump when he gave it to his Russians kleptocrat/friends/roommates from the old days of fucking each others wives at trump towers in the 90s.Now the MAGA right is a little too invested in their reality that they are the good guys with guns that they missed the fact that Betsy  DeVos (erik princes sister) decimating the U.S. school systems and the Kochs poisoning children with lead was not a coincidence., Humans have survived climate change before and can do it again - Guest: Michael E. Mann, ClimatologistYou listen to morons who claim that we have already reached 1.5c of warming despite it not being the case.\&amp;gt; we pass into the horrors of a 1.5 C plus world, at least 10 years earlier than the worst official expectationsHere's what actual definition of passing 1.5c is-"A single year above 1.5C (or 2C for that matter) would not mean that the world has passed that temperature target. Given the warming rate of 0.2C per decade since 1970, and the fact that a super El Nino event can add up to 0.2C to a specific years global temperatures through natural variability, it is possible for us to see a single year exceeding 1.5C a full decade before the long-term average warming driven by human emissions of greenhouse gases does. Because of this, we should be a bit cautious about how we interpret the first year passing 1.5C (whether it happens in 2023, 2024, or later)! Most models dont expect the longer term average to pass 1.5C until the early-to-mid 2030"[ morons also claim that IPCC models don't include aerosols, methane from permafrost and emissions from wildfires, which is demonstrably false-\&amp;gt; IPCC processes did not find an adequate way to address issues of extreme risk where data was deemed insufficient or where there was higher uncertainty \*, such as aerosols, methane release from permafrost, and feedbacks from wildfires or droughts rendering sinks incapable of sustaining their role in the system.If what they claim is true, then why are climate models used in previous IPCC reports so accurate and have predicted the pace of warming and most climate extremes so well, including exceptionally warm years like 2023? Observed warming tends to track middle-of-the-range estimates from previous IPCC reports.[ what actual climate scientists say on the matter-"So frustrating to see non-experts engage in knee-jerk criticisms of climate models for purportedly not including processes that (anyone with a clue knows) are in fact included. Please stop this people!]</td>

[Currently, humans collectively produce 37,120,000,000 tonnes of CO2 each year.]( tCO2  900 tCO2/plant = 41,244,444 plantsThis means that each plant can capture 900 tonnes of CO2 each year. We would need 41.2 million of these carbon capture plants running 24/7. So, how much energy would it then require us to remain carbon neutral?41,244,444 plants * 1,800,000 kWh/year = 74,239,999,200,000 kWh1 kWh = 0.000000001 tWh74,239,999,200,000 kWh = 74,239.999 tWh74,239.999 tWh, wow, that's a lot of electricity, right? But how much exactly is that? For comparison, [in a 2019 study by the International Energy Association, it was determined that the world uses 22,848 tWh of electricity each year.]( tWh  22,848 tWh = 3.249It would take more than 3.25 times the amount of electricity we currently use globally and 41.2 million carbon capture plants just to reach carbon neutral!, That is capturing 1 tonne of CO2 for every tonne of CO2 we emit globally. Something that would only keep us stable at current levels. Not what it would take for us to begin reducing the amount.First off, let's calculate how much energy would be required for a single plant to capture its yearly capacity of 900 tonnes.900 tonnes * 2000 kWh/tCO2 = 1,800,000 kWhSo, for a single plant to capture 900 tonnes of CO2, ***not including*** power requirements for the fans, transportation, or disposal, it would require 1.8 million kWh of electricity.Now, let's figure out how much CO2 we would need to produce to power a single carbon capture plant. [In 2019, the International Energy Association estimated that the global average of CO2 emitted per kWh was 475 grams of CO2 per 1 kWh.]( gCO2/kWh * 1,800,000 kWh = 855,000,000 gCO21 gram = 0.000001 tonne855,000,000 gCO2 = 855 tonnesSo, in order for us to lock 900 tonnes of CO2 into a stable chemical substance. We would need to produce 855 tones of CO2 just to meet the energy requirements of the chemical reaction. Add in the amount of energy required to run the fans to suck in the atmosphere, operate containment systems, and then transport and dispose of the carbon. You're now producing far more CO2 than you are actively capturing and removing from the system. In other words, carbon capture, with current technology, would produce more CO2 than could be captured. Thus solving nothing and actually make the problem worse.Now, if this wasn't enough, there is the sheer scale of the problem. Assuming we could magically get these carbon capture systems to remove more CO2 than they produce., How carbon removal technology is like a time machine | Sucking greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere could help address climate change. But so far, available technology is barely winding the clock back.You're off by at least a factor of 41.[Carbon capture systems would require 2,000 kWh per tonne of CO2 captured.]( remember that this is just what it takes to turn CO2 into a chemically stable substance. And being that it is the chemical process itself that requires this much, we will not be able to reduce it by much more. ***This is a hard fact about the energy needed for the chemical reaction to take place that traps the CO2.***Also, this 2000 kWh/tonne estimate does not include the amount of power that would be required to run the fans that suck in the atmosphere. Nor does it include the energy required to contain, transfer, and dispose of the CO2 after it has been captured.It should also be noted that this is based on our current most cutting-edge atmospheric carbon capture systems. A single plant can capture roughly 900 tonnes of CO2 each year.Now that you have an idea of what it takes to capture carbon. We can now explore what it would take to bring us down to carbon neutral.]</td>

Huge progress lmao!!!!!!!!!!!!, Were losing people. My 12-year old, what am I going to say to her when I come back?Like Ainuu, many delegates from vulnerable nations voiced frustration and anger at the draft deal unveiled Monday night at the climate summit, known as COP28. Unlike previous versions, the document did not[call for phasing out fossil fuels]( the root cause of rising global temperatures that have wrought devastation across the globe in the past year.Instead, the deal suggests reducing both consumption and production of fossil fuels, in a just, orderly and equitable manner" so that the world reaches net-zero emissions by mid-century. The language reflects a compromise among negotiators from nearly 200 nations, including fossil-fuel-dependent countries such as the United Arab Emirates  the host of this years talks and the worlds seventh-largest oil producer.The draft agreement is nearly the last step before the conclusion of COP28, at which, under the 2015 Paris agreement, countries are supposed to address how[to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius]( Fahrenheit). Poor and vulnerable countries have pushed for the agreement to include a phaseout of fossil fuels as the best chance of hitting the 1.5C target, a threshold beyond which scientists have warned of catastrophic effects, including flooded coastal cities and mass die-offs of coral reefs.Climate groups widely critiqued the text as being watered down, and they said it reflected the worlds reluctance to emphatically close out the era of coal, oil and gas. But the text, in even mentioning the desired reduction of fossil fuel consumption and production, would break new territory  if agreed to. No prior agreement from international climate talks, including the 2015 Paris accord, has directly taken on the topic of fossil fuels, instead focusing on the need to reduce emissions.**Read the full story here, and skip the paywall with email registration:** [**]</td>

Or..., How a Climate Group That Has Made Chaos Its Brand Got the White Houses Ear | In less than a year, Climate Defiance has drawn the admiration of activists and the ire of government leaders and CEOs. It may be a sign of an appetite among activists for more peaceful but confrontational direct action.WELLESLEY, Mass.The Wellesley Rotary Club was having a perfectly ordinary country club dinner on Thursday, Jan. 25, until about 18 climate activists hopped on stage and started talking about fossil fuels.Brian Moynihan is one of the top five funders of fossil fuels causing the climate crisis, Izzi Graj said to the crowd, before turning to event speaker and Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan. Other demonstrators crowded around the stage silently unfurled one banner reading Bank of Atrocities, with the Bank of America logo and another reading Business as Usual is a Climate Disaster.Brian, youre killing us, and turning a blind eye to devastating suffering, Graj said to Moynihan, voice raised to combat groans from the crowd that had paid $100 a head to attend the event, and wasnt interested in hearing how Bank of America was ranked one of the top five global financiers of fossil fuels in Banking on Climate Chaos latest report. Since the Wellesley action, Bank of America has also backtracked on prior commitments to stop financing coal.LBut Climate Defiance, whose members in attendance had also purchased tickets for the event, was determined to make sure the audience couldnt ignore that reality. The youth-led direct action organization born last March has a laser-focused mission: to use disruptive, strictly non-violent direct actions to speed the end of U.S. reliance on fossil fuels. Its part of a growing ecosystem of climate organizations that are using direct action to try to increase the political urgency to act on climate change, and get power players and the American public to respond to the science that shows meeting global climate goals requires a phase-out of fossil fuel use. It enters the scene following groups like Extinction Rebellion, Fridays for the Future and the Sunrise Movementclimate action-oriented organizations that have made waves nationally and globally. But even among peer organizations, Climate Defiance stands out for its tactic of birddogging the prominent people it targets and its rapid rise to notoriety. Since its inception last spring, the group has made frequent headlines and racked up millions of social media views, pursuing heavy hitters like Vice President Kamala Harris, White House national climate advisor Ali Zaidi, Senator Joe Manchin, Federal Reserve Bank Chair Jerome Powell, ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods and President Joe Biden.Most recently, the groupalongside partner organization Planet Over Profitconfronted former CIA director David Petraeus at a book talk in New York City on Friday, criticizing his firms involvement with the controversial Coastal GasLink pipeline in Canada and the excessive force and surveillance tactics used against pipeline opponents by Canadian police. Petraeus is chairman of the Global Institute at private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp;amp; Co, which is a majority stakeholder in the project.The group is unusually well-funded for a scrappy activist organization, and has a penchant for attracting influential friends, from members of Congress to Hollywood stars.Most of Climate Defiances actions follow the same simple formula executed in Wellesley: go to a fancy event with powerful, important people, loudly and visibly call them out for their fossil fuel ties and then post a video of the action on the internet. Respectability is not on the groups list of priorities. Were a radical collective of young people, the group posted on X in January. We are un-professionalized and high-key unhinged. At the Jan. 25 action in Wellesley, Moynihan did not respond to the groups questions, and within minutes, he quietly exited the room as they followed him chanting, off fossil fuels Brian, off fossil fuels.Rotary club guests responded to the protesters with calls of get the hell out. One jabbed a protester aggressively with their walking cane.]</td>

      <td>[Hopeless and broken: why the worlds top climate scientists are in despairThe non-stop propaganda opposing climate change policy from conservatives/extreme rightwing in the US and Canada, at least should be mentioned. It has been an uphill battle in Canada to implement climate change policies, provincial governments taking the federal government to court, lying and rage farming about climate change policies, its been utterly disgusting to see how effective propaganda can be.The leader of the federal Conservative Party in Canada, is way ahead in the polls after sounds more than a year on an axe the tax tour, lying about the amount of the carbon tax and ignoring that Canadians ger rebates which give more back to low and middle income families than they pay. Poilievre has opposed every environmental regulation, protection, and environmental policy in existence, and at the moment looks like he will win the next election.Its extremely depressing. The corporate press is not pushing back on the propaganda, and voters are being duped., Sea levels are starting to rise faster. Heres how much South Florida is expecting is an opinion piece,  but it makes valid points on what is taking place in both the US and Canada. The Rightwing is salivating at the chance to be cruel. To pay back people for imagined or misplaced slights. opinion piece that again lays out the specifics of the willful malice they have been driving their politics and policies on. here's the thing.The Right, in many countries across the world, are using stochastic terrorism as weapons to destabilize each nation they supposedly represent. They bask in the idea of paying the progressive people back, starting with social murder and expanding from there. People who were once friends feel like victims because they feel oppressed for not being able to act maliciously to others. People who own multiple properties,  with multi million dollar homes at lake lots, complaining of how unfair things are because of environmental issues,  education,  lgbtq,  the disabled and homeless. Becoming outrageously angry at the thought that they are being victimized by these groups.I've heard the calling for violence from people I used to respect and call friends, Celebrating the murder of autistic people by law enforcement. Voicing an eagerness to see more. The American and Canadian Right are both shifting to more extreme politics, and they are dragging their base right along with them.Yes. Absolutely. I know many who would live to kill someone because the Right have told them that many of their fellow citizens are their enemy. I'm no longer associated with any of these people., As global temperatures rise, are liberal democracies on trial?At least in the US, awash with hate\fear\lie based media (With Fox News being the flagship)  and with the Democrats' seeming inability to confront the Joseph Goebbels-like propaganda machine driving the US GOP due to the poor bonds between the Democrats' disparate subgroups it wont take much of a kick to bring the faade of constitutional order to the ground. As climate stress intensifies domestically, and the global economy gradually (or suddenly!) collapses from the compounded stress of polycrises like financial shock, frequent political  destabilization, and supply chain disruption, Americans will see their financial lives whither. We have 40 years of evidence showing how relatively modest shrinking of the US middle class has allowed MAGA to blossom and Hitler-wannabe Trump to be a viable candidate. And that's just the warm up act. As the climate crisis takes off the accumulating impact on ordinary people will make them increasingly desparate, and desparate people will increasingly follow whatever authoritarian manages to con them and make them feel safe. Overt in-your-face fascism will spread and its recruiters will have easy pickings. Its interesting that in the article its the economists warning about the risk to liberal democracy. Missing from this entire discussion is any mention that the problem of climate change is merely a symptom. A descent into the political abyss is inevitable unless we start addressing the root cause not just the symptom. The root cause is that the modern global economy is built on the foundational principle of perpetual economic growth addiction (PEGA). PEGA has always been a Ponzi scheme. The first stirrings of widespread awareness that PEGA is a multi century Ponzi scheme that is coming to its natural conclusion is starting to emerge. In the 1990s I'd go months - sometimes years - without seeing anyone writing about this.]</td>

Bush administration through the Obama administration and the Trump administration.But that changed once Biden took office, said Lipow.The same month he was sworn into office, Biden issued an executive order pausing permits for new oil and gas drilling and mandating more rigorous environmental reviews. In April of 2021, the administration set a target for a 50 to 52 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from 2005 levels.That summer, the administration canceled a key permit for the Keystone XL pipeline and blocked permits to drill in Alaskas Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.Despite the initial pause in issuing permits for production on federal lands, permits to drill increased, outpacing the Trump administration.Lipow said part of the reason for that is compromises the Biden administration had to make to pass the Inflation Reduction Act.It forced the administration to do a number of things, Lipow said.Among them was holding lease sales for millions of acres, including a sale for parcels of 958,000 acres in Alaska and one for 73.4 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico. Despite those sales, companies only bid for 5,700 acres in Alaska, and companies bid for 2.3 percent of the acreage offered in the Gulf., Bidens climate law fines oil companies for methane pollution.

The gist is that warming is accelerating beyond IPCC forecasts due to two primary factors overlooked by IPCC models:1. The albedo feedback: as ice melts and the Earth grows darker, it absorbs more solar heat.2. The decline in sulfate aerosols from ships, due to regulations requiring low-sulfur fuel oil. This has dramatically accelerated warming across the North Atlantic and North Pacific.In other words, buckle up., 35 Years After Addressing Congress, James Hansen Still Has Climate Warnings | The former NASA scientist James Hansen says in a new paper that global temperatures will pass a major milestone this decade, faster than other estimates predict.There are several different outlets covering his paper with somewhat different angles.

One suggestion is to increase taxes on resource extraction while lowering taxes on human labour  #GlobalCarbonFeeAndDividendPetitionAccording to [Statista.com]( the global net national income per capita was**8,700 U.S. dollars**in 2020., What ever good or service you tax, you add a friction to the growth of a certain section of the economy. This can help or hurt the economy and the economy is very complicated.Fuel literally fueled human economic growth for millennia. Taxing fuel is taxing one of the fundamental pillars of the economy. Sadly using fossil fuels have a terrible waste product. CO2.It is this waste product, CO2 that must be targeted with the highest precision. Excess GHG production is a red limit for our current civilization. And we hit it a while a go. Right now the planetary climatic engines have been running above  temperature, and lately blowing seals everywhere.This is not optional, we need fuels to eat. The waste fuel fossil fuels produces will destroy our world (not the world, just humanity).Thus we must  target precisely the problem, excess emission in the atmosphere, and lack of preparedness ( because of cowards hiding their heads in the sand).On Land Use: a land use tax will indeed create friction on land use.]</td>

Oh really, Tesla has been dropping the price of its cars like mad, yet still the best selling vehicle on the planet., Earth's latest 'vital signs' show the planet is in crisisI think a lot of the blame for our lack of response to the climate crisis *can* be attributed to our overvaluing of economic analysis, though. Climate scientists are naturally reserved when presenting their findings, highlighting limitations, caveats, and uncertainties for their work. While this is how scientific findings should be presented, it makes it easier for politicians and the public to dismiss the results and leads to inaction., Economists do this too, though to a lesser extent, and yet their word is often taken without a second thought. Economic metrics are the only thing people in power care about. They dont care about the Antarctic melting, coral reefs collapsing, or the Amazon burning, just how much is it gonna cost. But the estimates economists give them should have even more uncertainty associated with them than the predictions made by climate scientists. They really have no idea how climate change could impact the economy and yet they are the ones directing policy (or the lack thereof). This has caused real harm. The underestimation of climate impacts by economists directly led to US inaction in the 80s and 90s. Nathaniel Richs Losing Earth outlines this well and I highly recommend people read it.Its incredibly frustrating as a scientist to see governments only listen to economists on this, when their methodology and models pale in comparison to the physics-based climate models (which are nowhere close to be being perfect themselves).

The Prius V fit it nicely - and i was young and moved houses a lot.Its a 2012 and I still get 37.2 mpg. Love the car.]</td>

Sabine Hossenfelder, theoretical physicist #GlobalCarbonFeeAndDividendPetitionMy personal gripe with Nuclear is long-term, as with everything involving the environment, we are working with time spans beyond a human lifetime. To survive the next hundred years, and for the good of a sustainable climate that every life on the planet collectively has been working on for the past hundred thousand years or longer, Nuclear is a fine solution for electricity. Transportation infrastructure military and agricultural practices all need to be tackled immediately with the same urgency and long-term thinking. Nuclear isn't a forever solution but we're really still in our infancy and there are few cultures that still think about the next 40,000 years, Seven Generations, even Friedrich Nietzsche was grappling with this idea with Zarathustra]</td>

Not to mention the fact that carbon is essential for food growth. We have also bastardized the chicken and beef industries with garbage practices.
