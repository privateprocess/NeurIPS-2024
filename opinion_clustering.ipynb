It may be a sign of an appetite among activists for more peaceful but confrontational direct action.WELLESLEY, Mass.The Wellesley Rotary Club was having a perfectly ordinary country club dinner on Thursday, Jan. 25, until about 18 climate activists hopped on stage and started talking about fossil fuels.Brian Moynihan is one of the top five funders of fossil fuels causing the climate crisis, Izzi Graj said to the crowd, before turning to event speaker and Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan. Other demonstrators crowded around the stage silently unfurled one banner reading Bank of Atrocities, with the Bank of America logo and another reading Business as Usual is a Climate Disaster.Brian, youre killing us, and turning a blind eye to devastating suffering, Graj said to Moynihan, voice raised to combat groans from the crowd that had paid $100 a head to attend the event, and wasnt interested in hearing how Bank of America was ranked one of the top five global financiers of fossil fuels in Banking on Climate Chaos latest report. Since the Wellesley action, Bank of America has also backtracked on prior commitments to stop financing coal.LBut Climate Defiance, whose members in attendance had also purchased tickets for the event, was determined to make sure the audience couldnt ignore that reality. The youth-led direct action organization born last March has a laser-focused mission: to use disruptive, strictly non-violent direct actions to speed the end of U.S. reliance on fossil fuels. Its part of a growing ecosystem of climate organizations that are using direct action to try to increase the political urgency to act on climate change, and get power players and the American public to respond to the science that shows meeting global climate goals requires a phase-out of fossil fuel use. It enters the scene following groups like Extinction Rebellion, Fridays for the Future and the Sunrise Movementclimate action-oriented organizations that have made waves nationally and globally. But even among peer organizations, Climate Defiance stands out for its tactic of birddogging the prominent people it targets and its rapid rise to notoriety. Since its inception last spring, the group has made frequent headlines and racked up millions of social media views, pursuing heavy hitters like Vice President Kamala Harris, White House national climate advisor Ali Zaidi, Senator Joe Manchin, Federal Reserve Bank Chair Jerome Powell, ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods and President Joe Biden.Most recently, the groupalongside partner organization Planet Over Profitconfronted former CIA director David Petraeus at a book talk in New York City on Friday, criticizing his firms involvement with the controversial Coastal GasLink pipeline in Canada and the excessive force and surveillance tactics used against pipeline opponents by Canadian police. Petraeus is chairman of the Global Institute at private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co, which is a majority stakeholder in the project.The group is unusually well-funded for a scrappy activist organization, and has a penchant for attracting influential friends, from members of Congress to Hollywood stars.Most of Climate Defiances actions follow the same simple formula executed in Wellesley: go to a fancy event with powerful, important people, loudly and visibly call them out for their fossil fuel ties and then post a video of the action on the internet. Respectability is not on the groups list of priorities. Were a radical collective of young people, the group posted on X in January. We are un-professionalized and high-key unhinged. At the Jan. 25 action in Wellesley, Moynihan did not respond to the groups questions, and within minutes, he quietly exited the room as they followed him chanting, off fossil fuels Brian, off fossil fuels.Rotary club guests responded to the protesters with calls of get the hell out. One jabbed a protester aggressively with their walking cane.",

This may cause melting of the polar caps/collapse of the polar jet stream, which will raise temperatures on average after the ice and polar air isn't contained. Following this, we may see the collapse of the Ocean currents with the deluge of freshwater, which will raise temperatures even more, collapse the ocean food chain, and probably result in another great mass extinction that will kill most large mammals and terrestrial life and a sizeable amount of ocean life, with the exception of some soecies of plants and animals in northern areas, and a prodigious amount of jellyfish and Deepwater organisms.This is all very loosely phrased, but it's not an improbable series of events, and short of refrigerating the whole of Siberia, there's not much we can do to stop the permafrost issue once it's begun in earnest.",

However, the distillation of many trends into a global mean index obscures the variation that can inform conservation measures and can be sensitive to analytical decisions. For example, previous analyses have estimated a mean vertebrate decline of more than 50% since 1970 (Living Planet Index).Here we show, however, that this estimate is driven by less than 3% of vertebrate populations; if these extremely declining populations are excluded, the global trend switches to an increase. The sensitivity of global mean trends to outliers suggests that more informative indices are needed. We propose an alternative approach, which identifies clusters of extreme decline (or increase) that differ statistically from the majority of population trends.We show that, of taxonomicgeographic systems in the Living Planet Index, 16 systems contain clusters of extreme decline (comprising around 1% of populations; these extreme declines occur disproportionately in larger animals) and 7 contain extreme increases (around 0.4% of populations). The remaining 98.6% of populations across all systems showed no mean global trend.\"",

Gradually the researchers increased the population of rats in the fixed environment. Oh there was plenty of food and water. It just got more crowded. Eventually, the rats turned cannibal and ate each other. I do have optimism for the future that might emerge out of such a dystopia.

Data from January through October shows the planet is likely to average 1.3 degrees Celsius to 1.5 degrees Celsius above a preindustrial norm this year, the WMO said.Constraining global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels[is the worlds most important climate goal]( Scientists say it is becoming increasingly out of reach but that achieving it would[save coral reefs]( preserve polar ice and prevent dramatic sea-level rise. (Such warmth would need to sustain for years and decades at a time to face the worst consequences.)Petteri Taalas, the organizations secretary general, stressed that this years warming has had real-life harms around the world and pushed the planet to new weather and climate extremes.Greenhouse gas levels are record high.

          "What Trump promised oil CEOs as he asked them to steer $1 billion to his campaign | Donald Trump has pledged to scrap President Bidens policies on electric vehicles and wind energy, as well as other initiatives opposed by the fossil fuel industry.Trump has been laundering money for the Russian oligarchs since the late 80s when they all bought a condo at 725 5th ave (trump towers) to clean their freshly stolen USSR money after the iron curtain fell. except Putin thought the Cold War was over. Trump and Manafort (who lived in the tower also) just saw a pretty low maintence grift to be had.Trump had actually been Manafort and Roger stones first client at their lobbyist firm (1980)  wikiBlack, Manafort, Stone and KellyGuiliani as trumps attorney and New Yorks mayor was able to redirect NYPD investigations onto rival gang members/oligarchs to deflect any scrutiny off of trump, himself or the Russian connections. Russian election interference in 2016 was effectively a generation 3 version of what Manafort had done in the Philippines, then keeping Yanukovych in power as Putins puppet in Ukraine from 2002-14 when Maidan ran both Yanukovych and Manafort out of Ukraine as Ukrainians realized that, if you raise your lens high enough, corruption is an wholly unsustainable business model.Eventually the parasites greed always consumes the host. greatly underestimated the addictive properties of freedom when it invaded Ukraine so what was supposed to be a 3-10 day coup turned into a 2 year fight for the Ukrainians right not to be genocided.Russia depleted  its weapons stocks which were already the victim of vranyos corruption because every oligarch, admiral and sergeant in the Russian military is on the take. Every billion dollar tank maintenance contract turned into everything getting a spray paint overhaul and the vast majority of the redirected funds turned into an oligarchs new yacht or home in Aspen.Russia was forced to turn to China, North Korea and Iran for weapons because if they lose the 3-10 day special military operation in Ukraine the Russian empire is dead and cold.China cant risk showing their involvement in the Ukraine war so they use North Korea, and Iran to resupply Russia.Russia previously owed Iran some undelivered fighter jets that are already smoldering heaps in Ukraine so Iran now had the upper hand at the negotiation table for the first time in about 60 years. They supply Russia with shahed drones in exchange for Chinas material support against their sworn religious enemy, Israel. cant do much about it because he is slowly realizing that by setting the standard of corruption and stealing $200+ billion from his own people meant that every oligarch down in the mob model chain had not only permission but incentive and the expectation to steal from him as well. This is Vranyos. The mob model only works if the supreme leader is the most violent and can prove it without exception every damn day. But violence is exceptionally expensive when you are trying to present as a legitimate government or business. If Russia as a nation had an efficiency rating it would have been banned for sale in the state of California 25 years ago.The parasite ruling class stole all the energy out of the working class and collapsed it.Now Iran has the high hand and they get the intelligence that trump passed to Putin about the fact that Netanyahu cares far less about Jews, Palestinians or genocide than he does about remaining in power as an authoritarian because he too has developed Ritz Carlton tastes and his own corruption trial is showing the same tendrils of the money laundering scheme that trumps trials are. Netanyahu:We Have Strong Influence over America ,We Control The Congress,The Senate, The LobbyThey all hate each other but because they share the same money laundry, if one falls, they all fall. Hamas minted a couple billionaires as well that live in penthouses  in Qatar and get 30% of everything smuggled into Gaza. Netanyahu needs a bogeyman to stay in power. Thats why he coordinates with Hamas via Russia via Iran. handed Hamas everything they needed with Chinas help as secret Santa and the Russian intelligence given to them by the eternal shitbird trump when he gave it to his Russians kleptocrat/friends/roommates from the old days of fucking each others wives at trump towers in the 90s.Now the MAGA right is a little too invested in their reality that they are the good guys with guns that they missed the fact that Betsy  DeVos (erik princes sister) decimating the U.S. school systems and the Kochs poisoning children with lead was not a coincidence.",
          "Humans have survived climate change before and can do it again - Guest: Michael E. Mann, ClimatologistYou listen to morons who claim that we have already reached 1.5c of warming despite it not being the case.\\&gt; we pass into the horrors of a 1.5 C plus world, at least 10 years earlier than the worst official expectationsHere's what actual definition of passing 1.5c is-\"A single year above 1.5C (or 2C for that matter) would not mean that the world has passed that temperature target. Given the warming rate of 0.2C per decade since 1970, and the fact that a super El Nino event can add up to 0.2C to a specific years global temperatures through natural variability, it is possible for us to see a single year exceeding 1.5C a full decade before the long-term average warming driven by human emissions of greenhouse gases does. Because of this, we should be a bit cautious about how we interpret the first year passing 1.5C (whether it happens in 2023, 2024, or later)! Most models dont expect the longer term average to pass 1.5C until the early-to-mid 2030\"[ morons also claim that IPCC models don't include aerosols, methane from permafrost and emissions from wildfires, which is demonstrably false-\\&gt; IPCC processes did not find an adequate way to address issues of extreme risk where data was deemed insufficient or where there was higher uncertainty \\*, such as aerosols, methane release from permafrost, and feedbacks from wildfires or droughts rendering sinks incapable of sustaining their role in the system.If what they claim is true, then why are climate models used in previous IPCC reports so accurate and have predicted the pace of warming and most climate extremes so well, including exceptionally warm years like 2023? Observed warming tends to track middle-of-the-range estimates from previous IPCC reports.[ what actual climate scientists say on the matter-\"So frustrating to see non-experts engage in knee-jerk criticisms of climate models for purportedly not including processes that (anyone with a clue knows) are in fact included.

I can't be arsed to do the maths, but for example, we'd have to sustain 1.7c for several years into the 2030s for the average to be 1.5c because it would include the 2010s, which were below 1.5c.It's all a big joke.",

If atmospheric concentration of GHG gases does not decrease, the long-term equilibrium warming over several centuries to millenia could be 8-10 CYou shouldn't make any conclusions from a single study. There were a bunch of climate models in CMIP6(a set of models used in IPCC 6th assessment report) that showed a climate sensitivity similar to what is claimed in this study(up to 5.6c), way higher than the range from previous reports. However, scientists who worked on them and the report found that these models overestimate future warming(conclusion was based on paleoclimate data and other lines of evidence) and narrowed the range used in the report down to 2.5-4c, so actual ECS ending up beyond that range is not very likely.",

Emissions depend on the efficiency of the processes which can be different between the processes and different from what companies estimate emissions from the processes.&gt;I've seen more uncertainty about the emissions related to land use change.I don't know a lot about that but I would think that is true.

          "Exxon Wants You to Feel Guilty About Climate ChangeButte Montana actually has substantial climate data. They destroyed their ecosystem due to unregulated mining from the 1800s to about mid or late 1950s. Im talking toxic air, the Berkeley pit which people periodically would fall and practically disintegrate, poisoned drinking water, loss of local ecosystems ranging a from both flora and fauna and more. It wasnt until some serious environmental crack downs happened and some major accountability took place before change started happening. Especially for the Berkeley pit which still exists and is currently getting worked on and cleaned by the EPA. I first visited Montana when I was in the foster system around 2014, the pit was a deep dark red color and smelled horrible. It was also pretty deep and wide if I recall correctly. I visited again in 2018 and the pit was no longer smelly, the water level was lower and the water was a lot cleaner. Still murky, but very much cleaner. This town is why I still hold hope for climate change to have a positive turn around. Butte Montana was literally corrupt, and 100s upon 100s of people lost their lives, and millions were affected by the impacts of the ones running the operations, healthwise and more. They have a whole museum dedicated to the 150+ year industrialization and its consequences. The stark contrast between the photos of Buttes industrialization and mining operations  and their consequences on the environment compared to now give me hope. The fact that they as a community rose up and fought for change. And made it *happen.*Thats what itll take. And Im hopeful because now were collectively talking about climate change.

          "That is capturing 1 tonne of CO2 for every tonne of CO2 we emit globally. Something that would only keep us stable at current levels. Not what it would take for us to begin reducing the amount.First off, let's calculate how much energy would be required for a single plant to capture its yearly capacity of 900 tonnes.900 tonnes * 2000 kWh/tCO2 = 1,800,000 kWhSo, for a single plant to capture 900 tonnes of CO2, ***not including*** power requirements for the fans, transportation, or disposal, it would require 1.8 million kWh of electricity.Now, let's figure out how much CO2 we would need to produce to power a single carbon capture plant. [In 2019, the International Energy Association estimated that the global average of CO2 emitted per kWh was 475 grams of CO2 per 1 kWh.]( gCO2/kWh * 1,800,000 kWh = 855,000,000 gCO21 gram = 0.000001 tonne855,000,000 gCO2 = 855 tonnesSo, in order for us to lock 900 tonnes of CO2 into a stable chemical substance. We would need to produce 855 tones of CO2 just to meet the energy requirements of the chemical reaction. Add in the amount of energy required to run the fans to suck in the atmosphere, operate containment systems, and then transport and dispose of the carbon. You're now producing far more CO2 than you are actively capturing and removing from the system. In other words, carbon capture, with current technology, would produce more CO2 than could be captured. Thus solving nothing and actually make the problem worse.Now, if this wasn't enough, there is the sheer scale of the problem.

But everything I've seen getting built out has to be dependent on existing grid power for nights/cloudy days to make financial sense. The only plants I see actually getting shut down are coal plants and they are being replaced with gas, not complete solar systems with all the extra generation capacity and storage.Until storage costs come down, solar can only augment the grid, not provide primary base load power.I agree nuclear way is too expensive currently.

They bask in the idea of paying the progressive people back, starting with social murder and expanding from there. People who were once friends feel like victims because they feel oppressed for not being able to act maliciously to others. People who own multiple properties,  with multi million dollar homes at lake lots, complaining of how unfair things are because of environmental issues,  education,  lgbtq,  the disabled and homeless.

As climate stress intensifies domestically, and the global economy gradually (or suddenly!) collapses from the compounded stress of polycrises like financial shock, frequent political  destabilization, and supply chain disruption, Americans will see their financial lives whither. We have 40 years of evidence showing how relatively modest shrinking of the US middle class has allowed MAGA to blossom and Hitler-wannabe Trump to be a viable candidate. And that's just the warm up act. As the climate crisis takes off the accumulating impact on ordinary people will make them increasingly desparate, and desparate people will increasingly follow whatever authoritarian manages to con them and make them feel safe. Overt in-your-face fascism will spread and its recruiters will have easy pickings. Its interesting that in the article its the economists warning about the risk to liberal democracy. Missing from this entire discussion is any mention that the problem of climate change is merely a symptom. A descent into the political abyss is inevitable unless we start addressing the root cause not just the symptom. The root cause is that the modern global economy is built on the foundational principle of perpetual economic growth addiction (PEGA). PEGA has always been a Ponzi scheme. The first stirrings of widespread awareness that PEGA is a multi century Ponzi scheme that is coming to its natural conclusion is starting to emerge. In the 1990s I'd go months - sometimes years - without seeing anyone writing about this."

          "Were losing people. My 12-year old, what am I going to say to her when I come back?Like Ainuu, many delegates from vulnerable nations voiced frustration and anger at the draft deal unveiled Monday night at the climate summit, known as COP28. Unlike previous versions, the document did not[call for phasing out fossil fuels]( the root cause of rising global temperatures that have wrought devastation across the globe in the past year.Instead, the deal suggests reducing both consumption and production of fossil fuels, in a just, orderly and equitable manner\" so that the world reaches net-zero emissions by mid-century. The language reflects a compromise among negotiators from nearly 200 nations, including fossil-fuel-dependent countries such as the United Arab Emirates  the host of this years talks and the worlds seventh-largest oil producer.The draft agreement is nearly the last step before the conclusion of COP28, at which, under the 2015 Paris agreement, countries are supposed to address how[to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius]( Fahrenheit). Poor and vulnerable countries have pushed for the agreement to include a phaseout of fossil fuels as the best chance of hitting the 1.5C target, a threshold beyond which scientists have warned of catastrophic effects, including flooded coastal cities and mass die-offs of coral reefs.Climate groups widely critiqued the text as being watered down, and they said it reflected the worlds reluctance to emphatically close out the era of coal, oil and gas. But the text, in even mentioning the desired reduction of fossil fuel consumption and production, would break new territory  if agreed to. No prior agreement from international climate talks, including the 2015 Paris accord, has directly taken on the topic of fossil fuels, instead focusing on the need to reduce emissions.**Read the full story here, and skip the paywall with email registration:** [**",

          "According to many industry officials, policies regarding oil and gas seemed to change relatively little from the George W. Bush administration through the Obama administration and the Trump administration.But that changed once Biden took office, said Lipow.The same month he was sworn into office, Biden issued an executive order pausing permits for new oil and gas drilling and mandating more rigorous environmental reviews. In April of 2021, the administration set a target for a 50 to 52 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from 2005 levels.That summer, the administration canceled a key permit for the Keystone XL pipeline and blocked permits to drill in Alaskas Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.Despite the initial pause in issuing permits for production on federal lands, permits to drill increased, outpacing the Trump administration.Lipow said part of the reason for that is compromises the Biden administration had to make to pass the Inflation Reduction Act.It forced the administration to do a number of things, Lipow said.Among them was holding lease sales for millions of acres, including a sale for parcels of 958,000 acres in Alaska and one for 73.4 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico. Despite those sales, companies only bid for 5,700 acres in Alaska, and companies bid for 2.3 percent of the acreage offered in the Gulf.",

This will let you easily control their orientation to the Sun - from parallel to perpendicular and anywhere in between. They would have 2 degrees of freedom - one rotating around the X axis, the other around the Y axis. This would let us tilt them in a way that \"sails\" them North, South, East or West - with regard to their position above the Earth. 2. If they have a sufficiently low mass/area ratio - can they not be \"steered\" like a proper light sail? If we \"sail\" them around in a radial area that is just inside L1 - where the light pressure on them - when fully parallel - is enough to push them towards Earth - and the X/Y axis controls lets you move them around sort of in relation to Earth's Lat/Long. 3. I \"think\" L1 - for a big area, would be a bit concave towards the Earth - does that seem right. Let's imagine that the components of the system are disks - maybe made of aluminum alloy as the moon has a LOT of aluminum. We make them as thin as possible without losing their rigidity. I am not a mech engineer - but one option is to have an outer structural ring a few mms in diameter and then the remaining surface be lightly tensioned - but really really thin - like aluminum foil.

          "Millions More Trees Isnt the Climate Fix New Zealand ThoughtAll good my guy. Humans are omnivores, I don't think there is any real dispute on that. We absolutely are predisposed to eating meat. Again, I don't think there is any real contention on that either.That doesn't make your choice, or any other choices wrong. If you can eat more healthy without meat, power to you! If you come to my house, I'd make you vegetarian or vegan fare. Not because I do the same, but because you'd be a guest and it would be polite.I am sure there are plenty of people who have emotional reactions to people telling them to go vegetarian. That's likely due to identity politics more than an emotional attachment to eating meat. Your anecdotal evidence in your arguments doesn't really mean a whole lot, nor do the pictures posted.",

It causes around three times as much greenhouse gas emissions; uses around ten times as much land; two to twenty times as much freshwater; and creates much higher levels of eutrophication.",

          "We cannot eat grass, we desparately need the fertilizer, we need the leather, etc, pp.We need to eat the animals. (Who , by the way, would have no objection whatsoever to eating us, if they could. Yes, not even the cattle or the sheep or the goats.)There are lots of factors that the regular vegan bible just ignores or oversimplifies to somehow make a \"world without killing some animal species\" seem possible when in reality, it's not possible, and not even particularly helpful in the fight against earth heating.But what IS helpful is stopping to burn fossil fuels. Do that, and bam, the problem is basically solved.",

          "I'll never demand that Somali pastoralists go vegan)",
          "Exactly! My husband and I have been decreasing our meat consumption significantly. Eventually we know we will have to give it up mostly or entirely, but that is why we are starting now. My sister was mostly a vegan with a bit of dairy every now and again for a long time, but she had started experiencing some fairly major health issues. She worked with a doctor and a registered dietician and found out her body does not process plant protein correctly. They tried everything, so many different sources of protein. The team she was working with eventually recommended she start eating some fish, but even that wasn't enough. Eventually she was recommended to add poultry into her diet a couple of days a week. As soon as she did that her protein issues went away. She still eats mostly vegan with about 1-2 meals a week where she will eat some chicken. Obviously the vast majority of people could live vegan or mostly vegan lifestyles with no issues, but there are people that cannot, plus regenerative agriculture will need some version of animals to make it work. Could we just re-populate native species (like in the US the bison) 100% and that is what we should do and get rid of factory farming 100%.",
          "- The Boston GlobeExcept more soy is grown for animal feed worldwide than for human consumption, by a large margin. Include things like corn and wheat etc used in animal feed, and feed those animals for a year before slaughter and youve got a really dumb system of incredible inefficiency.",
          "I have a protein deficiency with a bunch of complicating factors. After 15 years of efforts, the only way we have been able to keep my protein levels even at the very low end of what's necessary is to keep certain animal-derived products in my diet. Please do not assume veganism is suitable for everyone.",

I do think theres benefit in telling your representatives and on voting for candidates that even if they are in conservative parties, actually do care about climate change. I think it used to be a really important component of conservative politics to think about the true sustainability and the long-term cost and benefit associated with sustainable living. But its really flown out the window since the bush days of investing in military complex in the Middle East to buy cheap oil. I also think that educating more people on climate change, the scientific and humanistic causes and the skills needed for solutions, including women, is necessary for changing the pulse of a culture. Therefore, I think it is important if you care about climate change to supporting strong education, and supporting women.

Right now the planetary climatic engines have been running above  temperature, and lately blowing seals everywhere.This is not optional, we need fuels to eat.

I'll paste it below:&gt; $110 billion for roads and bridges. In addition to construction and repair, the funding also helps pay for transportation research at universities, funding for Puerto Ricos highways, and congestion relief in American cities.&gt; $66 billion for railroads. Funding includes upgrades and maintenance of Americas passenger rail system and freight rail safety, but nothing for high-speed rail.&gt; $65 billion for the power grid. The bill would fund updates to power lines and cables, as well as provide money to prevent hacking of the power grid. Clean energy funding is also included.&gt; $65 billion for broadband. Includes funding to expand broadband in rural areas and in low-income communities. Approximately $14 billion of the total would help reduce Internet bills for low-income citizens.&gt; $55 billion for water infrastructure. This funding includes $15 billion for lead pipe replacement, $10 billion for chemical cleanup, and money to provide clean drinking water in tribal communities.&gt; $47 billion for cybersecurity and climate change. The Resilience Fund will protect infrastructure from cybersecurity attacks and address flooding, wildfires, coastal erosion, and droughts along with other extreme weather events.&gt; $39 billion for public transit. Funding here provides for upgrades to public transit systems nationwide. The allocation also includes money to create new bus routes and help make public transit more accessible to seniors and disabled Americans.&gt; $25 billion for airports. This allocation provides funding for major upgrades and expansions at U.S.",

The storms, fires, droughts, and floods are already baked in. Plus, these upgrades end up being more energy efficient and conserve more water, so they do both. Example: I recently helped a small town that was dealing with erosion and flood induced landslides taking out their water system. They were having to buy water and truck it in.",

These monies would be used to clean up superfund and brownfield sites, abandoned mines, and old oil and gas wells.&gt; $17 billion for ports. Half of the funds in this category would go to the Army Corps of Engineers for port infrastructure. Additional funds would go to the Coast Guard, ferry terminals, and reduction of truck emissions at ports.&gt; $11 billion for safety. Appropriations here are to address highway, pedestrian, pipeline, and other safety areas with highway safety getting the bulk of the funding.&gt; $8 billion for western water infrastructure. Ongoing drought conditions in the western half of the country will be addressed through investments in water treatment, storage, and reuse facilities.&gt; $7.5 bill for electric vehicle charging stations. The Biden administration asked for this funding to build significantly more charging stations for electric vehicles across the nation.&gt; $7.5 billion for electric school buses. With an emphasis on bus fleet replacement in low-income, rural, and tribal communities, this funding is expected to allow those communities to convert to zero-emission buses.",

Farms in my region have a mandate to cut emissions by 80% in that time and are on track thanks to these investments. Combined with the BIL, CHIPS, ARPA, and other investments, were looking at a 60-70% reduction overall by the end of the decade. Speaking of farms, ARPA and IRA funding is having a huge impact on local food systems, greatly reducing reliance on overseas (aka shipped) processing. That electric grid expansion I mentioned?"

Is your city among them?The earthquake risk list is interesting.Edit: this may be of interest a report filed in November 2008, the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency warns that a serious earthquake in the NMSZ could result in \"the highest economic losses due to a natural disaster in the United States,\" further predicting \"widespread and catastrophic\" damage across Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas, and particularly Tennessee, where a 7.7 magnitude quake would cause damage to tens of thousands of structures affecting water distribution, transportation systems, and other vital infrastructure.[24] The earthquake is expected to result in many thousands of fatalities, with more than 4,000 of the fatalities expected in Memphis alone.&gt;The potential for the recurrence of large earthquakes and their effects today on densely populated cities in and around the seismic zone has generated much research devoted to understanding the NMSZ. By studying evidence of past quakes and closely monitoring ground motion and current earthquake activity, scientists attempt to understand their causes and recurrence intervals.&gt;In October 2009, a team composed of University of Illinois and Virginia Tech researchers headed by Amr S. Elnashai, funded by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, considered a scenario where all three segments of the New Madrid fault ruptured simultaneously with a total earthquake magnitude of 7.7. The report found that there would be significant damage in the eight states studied  Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, and Tennessee  with the probability of additional damage in states farther from the NMSZ. Tennessee, Arkansas, and Missouri would be most severely impacted, and Memphis and St. Louis would be severely damaged. The report estimated 86,000 casualties, including 3,500 fatalities, 715,000 damaged buildings, and 7.2 million people displaced, with two million of those seeking shelter, primarily due to the lack of utility services. Direct economic losses, according to the report, would be at least $300 billion.[25]",

And this vid is a nice explanation of this new expansion of \"Global Warming in the Pipeline\". Well worth the time to watch. The gist is that warming is accelerating beyond IPCC forecasts due to two primary factors overlooked by IPCC models:1. The albedo feedback: as ice melts and the Earth grows darker, it absorbs more solar heat.2. The decline in sulfate aerosols from ships, due to regulations requiring low-sulfur fuel oil. This has dramatically accelerated warming across the North Atlantic and North Pacific.In other words, buckle up.",

For example if the US did it, I could see it trying to engineer things so life is worse in Russia or vice versa. You may be right that this is the only option, but that doesn't mean it won't lead to catastrophe, and in the context of empires and/or nation states led by idiots who want to harm each other... humanity may be put in an even worse situation.One thing we probably agree on though is that there are no easy or good options so it's all about what's the least bad way to maintain as habitable a planet as possible... but until humanity is more united, I see a lot of risks to your strategy, though I think you make a lot of good points.",

          "And especially outside the US. People need to remember that because of fraking boom we have some of the cheapest power in the world by far. In Michigan where I live most of the year my power is between 3 and 12 cents per KWH. So it averages about 7 cents checking my bill. Which means even in the summer my bill is maybe $200. My family house is where I am from in the Virgin Island. Power is 50 cents per KWH. It is also a big house. We are off grid with solar and batteries we put in ourselves for about 60k which sounds like a lot. But if the house was full which it will be soon we estimated in the summer the power bill would be 2k or more PER MONTH for the year with cooler times the bill per year would be an estimated 16k per year. So my pay off is less than 4 years. Plus we are getting an electric vehicle because gas is about $5 per gallon and we can fill the car for FREE during the day after the main battery charges which is usually before noon. So that is another 1-2k per year depending on driving, etc. So while in Michigan solar just doesn't make economic sense there are plenty of places where it is stupid not to use renewables.",

Again more innovation was needed at the time to make this mainstream that came after 2000. Jimmy Carter pulled a publicity stunt to energize his green constituency, this is obvious by Regan destroying this array when he took office. I agree the electric car EV-1 was innovative as I mentioned in a previous thread if innovation in the 1990s was better funded there could have been a much easier fight today on climate change, assuming modern technology isnt the limit on battery energy density, which as I mentioned has a safety issue that prevents commercialization.",

But the estimates economists give them should have even more uncertainty associated with them than the predictions made by climate scientists. They really have no idea how climate change could impact the economy and yet they are the ones directing policy (or the lack thereof). This has caused real harm. The underestimation of climate impacts by economists directly led to US inaction in the 80s and 90s. Nathaniel Richs Losing Earth outlines this well and I highly recommend people read it.Its incredibly frustrating as a scientist to see governments only listen to economists on this, when their methodology and models pale in comparison to the physics-based climate models (which are nowhere close to be being perfect themselves).

To survive the next hundred years, and for the good of a sustainable climate that every life on the planet collectively has been working on for the past hundred thousand years or longer, Nuclear is a fine solution for electricity. Transportation infrastructure military and agricultural practices all need to be tackled immediately with the same urgency and long-term thinking.
