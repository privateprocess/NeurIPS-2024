      "To put things in context: water has a great heat capacity (around 75 joule per mole of water to increase its temperature by 1C degree) which means a lot of energy absorbed on a global scale. Ice also needs a lot of energy to melt. When ice melts, it absorbs as much energy as it would take to heat an equivalent mass of water by 80 °C (176 °F). If one applies this knowledge to our current state of Earth, it's easy to understand that even if we pulled the break fully, the system's own drag will still cause major problems which will just get worse as global ice is likely to disappear.
